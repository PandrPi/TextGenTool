 chapter one the monster from the deep i am professor aronnax my job is to study everything dead or alive under the sea i see beautiful and ugly things down there bur there is one strange experience that stays in my mind like a nightmare it was some sailors said that they saw a dangerous giant monster living in the cold waters of the ocean some ships tried to find it and kill it but they never returned people said it looked like a whale it was feet long water came out of its back it was like a big underwater explosion the largest whale was only feet long and if these men were right this was even larger i was famous because i was the writer of a book called the mysteries of the great ocean depths when the captain of the american ship the abraham lincoln decided to leave and look for the monster he asked me to go with them as an expert the idea was very exciting i invited my faithful assistant and good friend conseil to go with me he always helps me to organise the names and places of the wonderful strange sea creatures that we find in the oceans of the world he accepted the invitation and we got ready to go the abraham lincoln left new york harbour on the rd of july five hundred thousand people were there to say goodbye ned land the famous whale killer was also on the ship farragut the captain of the ship was a strong and brave man when we first met he shook my hand and smiled at me dont worry the ocean isnt big enough for both the sea monster and me ill kill it or it will kill me i know is that one of us will die i didnt like this idea but i didnt say anything at the time we sailed for three months and we never saw the creature once the men wanted to find and kill the sea monster but after all this time everyone on the ship started to believe that there was no monster and then it happened it was nighttime and we were miles on the coast of japan when suddenly ned land the harpooner cried out there it is dont lose it i want it dead or alive the men on the ship began to run and shout get the ropes prepare the cannons the creature looked as if it was asleep we could see it because there was a strange light under the water then a cannon fired at the monster a cannonball hit it but it didnt move captain farragut didnt know what to do my god if a cannon cant kill this monster what can just then i saw ned land with his harpoon in his hands climbing to the front of the ship everyone watched him silently i saw the harpoon leave his hand and hit the giant creature right in its back water shot out of the wound its force knocked me right out of the ship into the dark cold ocean chapter two saved from the ocean i found myself underwater it was very cold and i tried hard to get to the top and breathe when my head was finally above the waves i saw that the abraham lincoln was more than one hundred feet away help help no one could hear me my clothes felt heavy in the water i felt something touch me on the leg i was terrified i thought it was a shark or even the monster sir are you all right sir thank god it was my faithful assistant conseil conseil my boy what are you doing here when i saw you fall into the water sir i felt it was my duty to follow you but why did you risk your life to save mine your life sir is more important than mine oh thank you you are a true friend but what happened to the ship im afraid the whale hit the ship sir it cant turn around it was true the abraham lincoln moved away from us it couldnt turn back it was dark and we knew that we had to stay in the water for the night we hoped dial in the morning someone from the ship could see us if we were still alive we were tired we tried to help each other swim the moon came out from behind the clouds and we saw that abraham lincoln was too far away just then we felt we couldnt swim any longer at that moment i touched something hard i thought it was a rock but then i realised it was metal conseil and i held onto it and then we heard a voice hey hey over here it was ned lands voice but we couldnt see him we tried to move onto this strange metal object to get close to him its me ned ned land did you fall into the water too i sure did and it was a good thing i landed on this i landed on the monster monster you mean were on the monster yes and its moving only its no monster its a ship he was right what all of us thought was a large whale was a threehundred foot long underwater ship ned sat on a platform which was on top of the ship we knocked on the ships sides but they were too thick and no one heard us we heard the noise of the ships engine i only hope it doesnt go under the water the mysterious ship began to sink before ned finished his sentence help help help suddenly the ship stopped sinking a short man in strange black clothes opened a secret door on the top of the ship when he saw us he ran back inside frightened two minutes later six large men with black masks came out took us by the arms and took us down inside the ship chapter three inside the nautilus they took us through a long dark tunnel we could see nothing around us they put us into a dark room then closed the door behind us a light came on the room was empty it only had a table and five chairs in the middle ned land got very angry they mustnt treat me like this i didnt do anything wrong im getting out of here do you hear me i want out ned screamed at the locked door but no one answered his call dont use all your energy mr land we may need it later quite right conseil as usual you speak with your mind and not your heart the door opened again after some minutes two men stood there in front of us one was tall with dark serious eyes the other was short he looked at us without any interest the two men wore black hats and shoes made from seal skin their clothes looked thin and comfortable they spoke a language which i did not understand i spoke to them in french german and english i told them our story but they did not seem to understand mr land got angry again you listen to me you let us off this ship or theres no reason to be angry mr land it is i who should be angry with you the tall man was calm and he spoke perfect english he surprised all of us and we didnt say a word you are on the nautilus i am its captain and my name is captain nemo this ship and my own life is a secret to the outside world i do not want to see that world again i live here under the sea you will stay here with me but you will have the same freedom everyone else on the ship has what does that mean captain that means that you are free to sec all the wonderful things under the sea no man in your world can ever see these things i am saying gentlemen that you are very lucky you mean well never go home again thats impossible mr land you gave me no choice i do not want anybody to know my secret you attacked my ship you found me now you must do what i say ned land was not happy at all i can only say that i was very interested in this strange man where did he come from why did he leave our world captain nemo spoke to the short man in their strange language then the short man left us then he tried to be friendly you will not find life on the nautilus so bad we have wonderful food and your rooms are very comfortable the captain showed ned and conseil to their rooms but he stopped me for a moment professor may i show you something why of course captain nemo took me down to the bottom of the nautilus where there was a room like a large museum it had pictures by famous painters on the walls and glass cases with beautiful shells from the sea i read your book professor you know a lot about sea life you see i enjoy sea life you have things here that most people only read about captain well i enjoy this room but what i really prefer is looking out there the captain pressed a button and two of the walls opened up behind them there were large glass windows looking out onto the sea a white light coming from the ship made everything easy to see i stood in front of the window like a small boy at the zoo and believe me i didnt feel at all like captain nemos prisoner chapter four outside the nautilus the nautilus travelled underwater watching the mysteries of the ocean the captain and his crew were excellent hosts they gave us wonderful sea food and we were free to visit any place we liked on the ship we travelled near the coasts of australia and papua new guinea i enjoyed seeing all the strange sea life of these waters i had enough information to write a new book but ned land was not happy on the nautilus he was a whale hunter and his life was above the water hunting whales one morning he asked conseil and me to go to his room to talk i want to talk about our escape our escape we are underwater how can we escape not now this ship goes above water every two days to fill it with clean air when we re near land we have to try to escape the waters we are in now are full of sharks mr land i know that professor well wait when we get close to a country we know well try to escape but how will we leave the nautilus ned land had no time to answer this question there was a loud crash and we all fell to the floor the lights went on and off and the engine stopped the top of the nautilus was just above the surface of the water i saw captain nemo on the platform outside the ship the ship was between two large rocks unable to move we had to wait six days for the water to rise before the ship could leave the captain didnt seem at all worried the sea brought us here the sea will take us away we were very close to papua i could see it from the ship ned land asked the captain if we could go on land and hunt some animals because he didnt want to eat fish captain nemo let the three of us go this didnt surprise me at all there were only cannibals on papua we couldnt escape because they would kill us there was a small boat on the nautilus which we used to get to land captain nemo gave us gnus and we were all excited to return to land and feel free again the beach of papua was beautiful it had soft white sand and foottall palm trees we found bananas and coconuts and we made a small camping area for the day some wild animals came out of the forest and ran away conseil was at first frightened i thought they were the cannibals dont worry conseil its not yet lunchtime we all laughed then continued looking for fruit and vegetables we walked through the tropical forest we were so excited by this new adventure that we forgot where we were walking we were far from the beach i felt something small hit my head i think i was hit by a rock a rock theres another suddenly we saw others moving through the forest professor sir were not alone there were cannibals everywhere we ran back to the beach they followed us they carried spears and shouted in a strange language we jumped into the boat leaving all our food and guns behind they got into the water after us some of them came in their own boats they threw spears at us but they all missed we jumped back on the nautilus and went below i found captain nemo in a small room next to the museum he was playing the piano captain there are cannibals outside the nautilus the sea professor and music make me feel very peaceful captain did you hear me i did and there is no reason to worry the nautilus is perfectly safe from those outside it the captain left the piano and went out of the room he and some of his men went up and opened the outside door of the nautilus several cannibals looked down inside one tried to get in but when his hand touched the ship he screamed another tried the same thing and he also screamed soon all of them swam away you see professor there is electricity around that door anyone who touches it feels great pain i felt terrified the captain had everything he needed lo protect himself and his men he also had everything he needed to keep us prisoners chapter five an underwater cemetery the nautilus was finally free of the rocks near papua we now travelled east past australia and into the indian ocean life on the ship was normal again we sometimes stopped on the ocean floor and walked outside the ship we wore special suits they had large glass heads with special tanks filled with air so we could breathe ned land still wanted to escape and he thought about it every day but now that we were in the indian ocean there was nowhere to escape to one afternoon while the nautilus was on the surface of the water i went upstairs to have a look outside i saw captain nemo looking through a telescope at something far away he said something to one of his men and the man went downstairs quickly the captain looked very serious i had a small telescope with me so i put it up to my eye to see what he was looking at at that moment i felt a strong hand knock the telescope away from my eye professor i want you to go below you mr land and mr conseil will stay in your rooms until i say you can leave may i ask why no there was nothing more to say captain nemo was upset about something and he had the power to tell us what to do i went to my room quietly they served our dinner in our rooms i fell asleep quickly when i woke up i thought that they put something in our food to make us sleep the next afternoon captain nemo suddenly opened my door he came in with one of his men he looked very worried professor do you know anything about medicine do you mean am i a doctor yes i know some things why i have a man who needs help could you have a look at him of course captain nemo took me to a room where there was a man lying on a bed he had white bandages on his head there was blood on the bandages and the man looked very sick he was cold and white i told captain nemo that he would not live the captains face changed he looked very sad and there were tears in his eyes may i ask what happened the captain turned away from me what does it matter a man will die isnt that enough captain nemo surprised me at times he could be cold and serious then he could cry for a member of his crew you can go professor the next day i saw the captain on the platform it was a bright sunny day i did not want to say anything about the sick man but i was curious i asked him if he wanted to go for a walk on the ocean floor he said yes so we put our suits on and off we went the indian ocean had the most beautiful rocks plants and fish in the world all of us enjoyed it very much it was like a colourful picture show but captain nemo had another reason for our walk i saw that his men carried something long and flat in a bag they also had tools to dig with then we arrived at a safe area with large plants around it they put the bag down and began digging at that moment i understood everything they were going to bury the dead man when we returned to the nautilus i told captain nemo that his man was safe where he was not even the sharks can go there captain or men professor chapter six the giant pearl and the shark we travelled in the indian ocean for ten days the nautilus did not seem to have any particular direction i did not see captain nemo for some days after the mans death he stayed locked in his room the ship was quiet one day conseil ned land and i were in the museum room we were looking through the underwater windows at the beautiful fish i wanted to know what the others thought of captain nemo conseil said i think hes a scientist who never had any success thats why hes here under the sea hes not famous and hes angry about that i think hes crazy and we will die here unless we escape i think youre both wrong hes angry about something he is not free here he loves the sea yes but here is something missing from his life maybe he blames someone for that and i think he wants to hurt that person as i said this the walls closed over the side windows and captain nemo walked in would you like to go pearl fishing this is the richest part of the world to fish for pearls we all looked at each other and agreed we were prisoners but it was exciting to see all of the mysteries under the sea the ocean near india has thousands of oysters the pearls inside them can cost hundreds of dollars there are many sharks in these waters and its very dangerous to go looking for pearls there i didnt like the idea of sharks we only had small knives to fight them with ned land had his harpoon with him but he was very busy trying to collect as many oysters as he could captain nemo took us to a small cave inside it i saw an oyster over six feet wide it had a pearl inside it as big as a coconut i wanted to take it back to the ship with us it was the only one of its kind in the world but captain nemo said no he wanted the pearl to grow alone there in the cave until it was truly the most fantastic pearl in the world on the way back to the ship we saw an indian boy swimming for pearls we hid behind some rocks so he couldnt see us suddenly a large shark swam nearby the boy saw it but it was too late captain nemo swam away from the rocks with his knife in his hand and began fighting with the animal the boy looked terrified captain nemo fought with the shark and there was blood in the water the captain looked in trouble immediately ned land attacked and killed the shark with his harpoon the captain was safe and i was so surprised that i couldnt move when we got back to the nautilus the captain thanked ned land you saved my life mr land thank you dont thank me i kill sharks and whales because its my job i didnt do it for you come mr land thats a horrible thing to say its alright conseil i understand mr land i saw in his face that he did understand ned land we were prisoners ned lands only thought was to escape captain nemo understood that thought he would feel the same way if he were in ned lands position chapter seven the lost city captain nemo took us north through the indian ocean to the red sea but the red sea had no exit as we got closer to egypt i went upstairs to the glass room at the top of the ship it was dark outside we were a long way under the sea captain nemo turned on the outside lights i dont understand captain there is no exit here we cannot go through the land but we can go under it watch we moved down below the country of egypt suddenly i saw a large hole in the rock a tunnel thats right professor and we are going through the nautilus shook as we went through the small tunnel it looked like an old cave then water surrounded the ship and there was no more land when conseil and ned woke up i told them that we were in the mediterranean sea but how who cares how nows our chance when we go up again were going to escape were close to europe and we can take the small boat to get to land do you agree i could not think only of myself conseil loved the sea but i did not think he wanted to live his life there ned land could not escape without our help i agree only tell me when you are ready but the nautilus did not go near the surface of the water again for some time in fact we went further down ned land stayed in his room i felt sorry for him but i loved the sea for many hours i stood in front of the window in the museum we sailed through the mediterranean sea and entered the deep mysterious atlantic ocean the ocean became dark and we continued to go further and further down captain nemo came into the museum as i studied the ocean floor i have a little surprise for you professor as he said this a bright light appeared from behind the mountain of rocks in front of us what is it just watch we came closer to the light and i could see trees on the ocean floor thats not possible the nautilus moved up over the mountain and i saw that the light came from an old underwater volcano there was no fire but the hot lava still produced light the light showed us part of the ocean floor there were stone houses and ancient temples on it i did not understand how such things could be there it looks like a city from thousands of years ago it is its the lost city of atlantis i looked up at captain nemo he never took his eyes off the window i looked down again so it was true i thought atlantis did exist but only captain nemo knew for sure chapter eight the giant squid we travelled through the atlantic ocean down to the south pole we went under the ice and came out on the other side imagine what we saw penguins whales polar bears dolphins icebergs it was like a dream and we saw it from the inside of the nautilus we continued up the coast of south america finally we came to the warm waters near the bahamas who could be unhappy only one person ned land conseil ned and i were in the museum looking out at old stone walls feet under the sea there are giant squid in the holes of those walls come professor you dont believe that do you what giant squid sir well the giant squid is really just a story many people like to tell stories about giant squid but no one knows if they are true but i know one man who said he saw one how long was it twenty feet did it have eight tentacles like snakes coming out of a big round head yes and did it have a mouth and nose like a birds yes why conseil because i think i see it right there i looked out of the window and there was a foot giant squid it moved close to the nautilus and it hit the window with its long tentacles the nautilus was too strong for it but it was a very frightening creature soon other smaller squid came near the window they all wanted to attack the ship they did not know what it was suddenly the nautilus stopped captain nemo came into the museum is something wrong captain yes one of those ugly creatures is caught in our propeller what can we do we can take the ship up then try to free the monster captain nemo never thought of danger he thought nothing could stop him his men or his ship we all went upstairs captain nemo gave us all axes to cut the squids tentacles if they attacked one man went to open the door to the platform as he opened it a long thick tentacle of the giant squid came inside like a snake and pulled the man outside we all ran up the stairs outside six or seven small squid moved along the top of the nautilus throwing all their tentacles at the ship and its men we fought them with our axes but the large one the one with captain nemos man in his tentacle stood holding the man in the air the man cried for help help help i was surprised he spoke english captain nemo attacked the giant squid with his axe he cut off some of its tentacles i thought captain nemo would save his man then i saw ned land with his harpoon in his hand i thought he was going to kill the captain ned dont but i didnt need to stop him one of the smaller squid knocked the harpoon out of his hand and threw ned down the squid was about to pull him into the sea captain nemo saw this cut off the squids tentacle and saved ned land you saved my life didnt you do the same for me yes but captain nemo did not wait for the answer he turned to help his own man but it was too late the giant squid shot black ink out of its body and none of us could see anything when we cleaned our faces and our eyes the squid was gone taking the man with it chapter nine the battle the nautilus was quiet again the only sound we could hear was the ships engine captain nemo stayed in his library i didnt see him for several days the same thing happened after the death of one of his men i thought there was something more to this maybe captain nemo thought that soon all his men would die and the nautilus and his secret would be lost ned land could not wait any longer i want you to talk to the captain professor ask him if we can leave now is not the time ned it is if you dont speak to him im going to do it myself alright ned ill do it when soon no professor now i had no choice ned land lost his temper and i thought captain nemo might listen to me and let us go i found the captain in his library he stood and looked at a picture of a young woman with two small children he didnt hear me go in he looked very sad who was this woman was it his wife my leg hit a table and captain nemo turned around im sorry captain i came to speak to you not now professor im afraid its important what is it its about our freedom the men and i need to know what you plan to do with us i already told you captain you cant expect us to stay on this ship for ever professor you found me i did not find you no one who enters the nautilus ever leaves there is nothing else to say suddenly i heard a voice shaking in that strange language the voice came from another room it was one of the captains men the captain became very angry professor i want you to go to your room i left the captain but i didnt return to my room i went upstairs to the platform there i found ned and conseil sir its a ship there was a ship travelling very fast towards us hey were over here ned land tried to call the ship over the ship answered with cannonball theyre firing at us hey over here dont shoot suddenly ned land saw captain nemo i want all three of you to go to your rooms now the ship came closer captain nemos men got ready to fight it this is my real enemy they killed my friends and family now its my turn to kill them captain nemo put a black flag on the nautilus with a yellow n in the centre of it we all went down inside the ship i watched the fight from the glass window in the museum the nautilus shook from the explosions of the cannonballs in the water but it went forward ready to attack the enemy ship the nautilus made a hole in the bottom of the enemy ship with its sharp nose i saw the men on the other ship fall into the water there was a loud explosion and then silence chapter ten the whirlpool captain nemo was not the man i thought he was i had respect for him as a scientist but he murdered those men on the other ship after the terrible battle with the enemy ship everything on the nautilus was quiet i did not see captain nemo or any of his men we travelled underwater never coming up except for air ned and conseil stayed in their rooms we all felt the same now the adventure of the nautilus was not exciting or interesting it was ugly and deadly the only thing we wanted was to escape ned land came into my room one night and woke me up we were in the north sea near the coast of norway professor wake up the boats ready now is the time can you see land yes about twenty miles away we have to try i agree ill go up first conseil is there wait for two minutes then come up after me if anyone stops you kill them ned land put a fishing knife in my hand and left the room i looked around one more time this was my home for nine months for most of that time i enjoyed it but now i had to leave as i walked through the museum to the stairs i heard music coming from captain nemos library i listened to him playing the piano and i thought i heard him say enough oh god enough those were captain nemos last words i found ned land and conseil in the small boat on the platform ned worked quickly to set if free the nautilus suddenly began to turn round in circles the men below began to shout whats happening sir i dont know get ready im almost finished suddenly i thought i understood what the men below said in their strange language the nautilus was in a whirlpool the waters off the coast of norway were famous for this boats which sailed into these whirlpools never escaped what shall we do professor dont free the boat well never make it i cant hold it were going to i heard a loud snap something hit me on the head and thats the last thing i remember i am writing this now some months later i am safe now the whirlpool threw our boat away from the nautilus some fishermen found us and took us to the shore i do not know what happened to captain nemo and the nautilus maybe he is still alive living under the sea all i know is that we travelled leagues under the sea from the pacific to the indian ocean through the reel sea and the mediterranean across the atlantic and to the north and south poles i saw things that no man from my world will ever see it was a strange and wonderful adventure one i will never forget the end
