preface interlude of the four elements calisto and melibaea everyman a moral play hickscorner the pardoner and the friar the world and the child mundus and infans gods promises the four pp a new interlude called thersites footnotespreface after the lapse of about half a century since the issue of the last edition of dodsleys select collection of old plays and the admittance of that work into the honourable rank of scarce and dear books it seemed a desirable thing to attempt with such additional improvements as might be practicable or expedient a revival of a publication which has been a favourite with the lovers of our early drama since its first publication more than a hundred years ago between the date of its original appearance and it passed through three editions and it may be remarked that the tendency in each successive edition has been to remodel the undertaking on the principle of rejecting plays which from time to time have been lifted up so to speak into the collected works of their respective authors and to substitute for them plays which have either suffered unmerited obscurity in original and rare editions or have lain so far scattered about in various other collections and in the present instance that principle has been strictly adhered to it is desirable that it should be seen precisely in what manner and to what extent the edition now offered differs from its predecessors as regards the contents the points of variation are three omissions additions of pieces not included in the former editions additional plays now first reprinted from the originals the first division comprises the following productions which since the last republication of dodsley have been taken up into the collected editions of their respective authorsferrex and porrex sackville c alexander and campaspe lyly jew of malta marlowe friar bacon and friar bungay greene edward the first peele edward the second marlowe pinner of wakefield greene four prentices of

book are the additions which as we have stated are of two kinds in the first place we may enumerate the dramas new to dodsleys collection though previously edited in a variety of forms interlude of

sir william berkley or barkley the marriage night by lord falkland the shepherds holiday by joseph butter andromana by js and all mistaken or the mad couple which were given by dodsley in but were omitted in the second and third impressions have been restored to their places the remaining feature recommending the undertaking to indulgent notice is perhaps the most important and interesting subjoined is a list of the dramatic compositions which have never hitherto appeared in any series of old english plays and of which the originals are of the utmost rarity the tragicomedy of calisto and melibaea nice wanton an interlude an interlude called like will to like by ulpian fulwell the history of jacob and esau the marriage of wit and science a strictly chronological arrangement has been adopted such a plan appeared to be the most desirable and the most obvious as it facilitates our appreciation of the gradual and progressive development of dramatic composition if it may be thought to labour under any disadvantage it is perhaps that it has the effect of throwing into a single consecutive series without discrimination pieces which are mere interludes and others which are characterised by higher qualities and aspire to belong to the regular drama but the evil will be found not to be of a very serious kind and it will disappear after the earlier volumes of the collection in fixing the order of sequence the place of a production in the series has been occasionally determined by the date at which it is believed to have been written or presented rather than by the date at which it left the printers hands such is the case with heywoods pardoner and friar and the anonymous interlude of new custom as well as with ralph roister doister and gammer gurtons needle all of which may be taken to belong to a period some time anterior to their publication a leading characteristic of the collection as now reconstructed is the great preponderance of pieces of which the authors are not known or by authors who have not left more than one or two dramatic productions it was judged expedient in the interest of purchasers to give a preference to these single or anonymous plays as it will probably not be long before the works of every voluminous writer are collected those of jonson shirley peele greene ford massinger middleton and chapman have already been edited and bromes deckers heywoods and glapthornes will follow in due course to all these the new dodsley will serve as a supplement and companion the editor felt himself in a position of somewhat special difficulty and delicacy when it became necessary to consider the question of retaining or excluding the prefatory matter attached to the impressions of this work in and a careful and impartial perusal of that matter made it evident that the prudent course on the whole was to reject these prolegomena there was no alternative but their entire preservation or their entire suppression for any arbitrary alterations or curtailments would have been liable to objection or censure in the first place there was dodsleys own preface chiefly occupied by a sketch of the history of our stage but based on the most imperfect information and extremely unsatisfactory if not misleading then there was like pelion heaped on ossa isaac reeds introduction more elaborate and copious than dodsleys yet far from complete or systematic and not improved by the presence of an appendix or sequel reed of course went over the same ground as dodsley had already traversed with inferior ability and less ample resources at his command and there were repetitions as might be expected of the same particulars there seemed to be two forms of weaknessredundancy on the one hand and meagreness on the other again all the information collected by dodsley and reed was to be found elsewhere with innumerable improvements and corrections of mistakes the subject itself more methodically handled and the early annals of the english drama and theatre almost presented to the public view under a new aspect by mr collier in his wellknown work printed in a publication heartily welcomed and appreciated at the time of its appearance and long after and even now a literary monument of which it may be said that with whatever defects it may possess it reflects as much credit on its author as a far more perfect performance brought to completion at the present day under more favourable auspices could reflect on any one else it was a long advance on anything which had been attempted so far in the same direction and to reproduce in the face of mr colliers volumes the obsolete and superseded labours of dodsley and even reed seemed to be a waste of space which might be far more beneficially occupied by additional texts as regards the orthography it has to be pointed out that in consonance with the system adopted by dyce and others it has been reduced to our modern standard but at the same time it should be understood that the language of the writers has in every case been held sacred than the spelling which occurs in early plays and tracts more especially perhaps those of a popular character nothing can well be more capricious and uncouth but the phraseology and terms are on all accounts of value not a word therefore nor even part of a word has suffered alteration and wherever there was a doubt as there might be in preparing for the press once more such an extensive collection of pieces it was thought better to err on the side of caution weever the author of funeral monuments retained with scrupulous exactitude the ancient spelling ipsissimis verbis and such a plan might be advisable and convenient with sepulchral inscriptions or records but in the matter before us what an editor had principally if not almost exclusively to consider was the preservation in their fullest integrity of the language of the time and the sense of the playwright the first and second editions of dodsleys collection appear notwithstanding what is asserted to the contrary in reeds preface to have been superintended with no very high degree of care and the late mr dyce indeed used to observe that the same criticism was applicable to the edition of but the latter with the fullest admission of its defects iscertainly marked by great improvements on its predecessors in more than one way the labours of hawkins and dilke reflect considerable honour upon those gentlemen it is almost superfluous to observe that the preceding editions the last and best not excepted present a very large number of statements opinions and readings which more recent and more exact information has shown to be erroneous all these mistakes have been carefully rectified wherever the knowledge and experience of the editor enabled him to detect them a certain number of corruptions and obscurities remain which it passed the editors ingenuity to eradicate or clear away the printed remains of our early drama have come down to us for the most part in a sadly mutilated state and the attempt to amend and restore the text to its original purity will it may be safely affirmed never succeed more than to a very imperfect extent even the late mr dyces revised edition of shakespeare abounds with misprints and other distortions of the writers sense and we must abandon in some cases the hope of ever arriving at the true readings so it is with the miscellaneous assemblage of dramatic productions here brought together a great deal has been done by a succession of editors to reduce the errors of the printer or copyist to a minimum but after all there are places where it would require the assistance of the sphinx to supply a chasm or rectify a palpable mistake the work in its present state should assuredly have some degree of interest and worth for it offers in one collected body the best specimens of dramatic literature which the english language affords castigated and enriched by some of our best commentators and critics in these volumes as now rearranged it is trusted that very few uncollected plays of real importance will be found wanting but as an enterprise of this kind can never amount to more than a selection as it purports to be it appeared judicious in making the choice to give the preference to such pieces as either illustrated the manners of the period or marked the gradual development of the dramatic art the only basis on which the present editor can rest so far as he is aware the slightest claim to credit is the attention which he has bestowed on the rearrangement of the collection as it now stands the conscientious and vigilant supervision of the whole matter here brought togetherprefaces texts and notesand the correction of errors on the part of his predecessors occasioned by a variety of causes in carrying out even this unambitious programme there was a fair share of labour and difficulty and of course it has involved the addition of a new crop of notes scattered up and down the series as well as the occasional displacement of certain illustrative remarks founded on wrong data the notes without any initial attached to them in the following pages may be presumed to be from the pen of isaac reed with the exception of a limited number which were written by dodsley himself and which are not easily mistakable the matter signed s appears to have been communicated to reed by george steevens the c notes are mr colliers and og stands for octavius gilchrist for the notes which remain and which have been enclosed between brackets the present editor alone is answerable it is proposed to introduce in the concluding volume two indexes one of names and another of subjects as the want of a ready means of reference to passages phrases and characters in these old plays is one which the editor himself has so strongly felt as to make him desirous of removing it so far as possible for his own sake and that of the public the long table of errata to the former edition has of course been attended to and the additional notes there placed at the end have been arranged under their respective heads wch kensington st november dedication to sir clement cotterel dormer kt sirif there be anything in this collection worthy of being preserved it is to you the public is indebted for the benefit your obliging readiness to communicate the stores of which you were possessed encouraged me to undertake the design which otherwise i should have despaired of prosecuting with success under the sanction of your name therefore i beg leave to shelter the remains of these old dramatic writers which but for your generosity had fallen with their authors into utter oblivion to your candour i submit the pains i have taken to give a tolerably correct edition ofthem and am with great respect sir your most obliged and obedient humble servant r dodsley interlude of the four elements a new interlude and a merry of the nature of the four elements declaring many proper points of philosophy natural and of divers strange lands and of divers strange effects and causes which interlude if the whole matter be played will contain the space of an hour and a half but if ye list ye may leave out much of the sad matter as the messengers part and some of natures part and some of experiences part and yet the matter will depend conveniently and then it will not be past threequarters of an hour of length london john rastell vo black lettermr halliwells preface to the former edition the curious interlude reprinted in the following pages is one of the earliest moral plays in the english language known to exist and it possesses an interest beyond its connection with the history of the stage as being the only dramatic piece extant in which science is attempted to be made popular through the medium of theatrical representation only one copy of it is known to exist but that is unfortunately imperfect a sheet in the middle and concluding leaves being lost so that we are left without the means of giving the reader much information respecting it on the other hand while this circumstance must excuse the brevity of these preliminary observations its singularity and extreme rarity offered additional inducements for selecting it for republication an allusion to the discovery of the west indies and america within this twenty year would appear to ascertain the date of the composition of the play but i suspect from internal evidence the form and manner of its dialogue that it was not written so early as some authors have supposed dr dibdin assigning to the period of its appearance the same writer considers it to be a production of rastells press and it has been stated on somewhat doubtful authority that the printer was also the author a combination that has seldom effected much service and has too frequently deteriorated the efforts of both be this as it may no great talent is displayed in the construction of the following piece the value of which must be allowed to consist in the curious illustration it affords of the phraseology and popular scientific knowledge of the day and its curiosity as a link in the history of the drama rather than in any intrinsic merits of its own it is only necessary to add that the play was rather carelessly printed and a few very obvious errors have been corrected with these exceptions the following pages present a faithful copy of the original a very small octavo volume in black letterinterlude of the four elements the names of the players here follow the names of the players the messenger nature naturate humanity studious desire sensual appetite the taverner experience ignorance also if ye list ye may bring in a disguising here follow divers matters which be in this interlude contained of the situation of the four elements that is to say the earth the water the air and fire and of their qualities and properties and of the generation and corruption of things made of the commixtion of them of certain conclusions proving that the earth must needs be round and that it hangeth in the midst of the firmament and that it is in circumference above miles of certain conclusions proving that the sea lieth round upon the earth of certain points of cosmography as how and where the sea covereth the earth and of divers strange regions and lands and which way they lie and of the newfound lands and the manner of the people of the generation and cause of stone and metal and of plants and herbs of the generation and cause of wellsprings and rivers and of the cause of hot fumes that come out of the earth and of the cause of the baths of water in the earth which be perpetually hot of the cause of the ebb and flood of the sea of the cause of rain snow and hail of the cause of the winds and thunder of the cause of the lightning of blazing stars and flames flying in the air the messenger th abundant grace of the power divine which doth illumine the world environ preserve this audience and cause them to incline to charity this is my petition for by your patience and supportation a little interlude late made and prepared before your presence here shall be declared which of a few conclusions is contrived and points of philosophy natural but though the matter be not so well declared as a great clerk could do nor so substantial yet the author hereof requireth you allthough he be ignorant and can little skill to regard his only intent and goodwill which in his mind hath ofttimes pondered what number of books in our tongue maternal of toys and trifles be made and imprinted and few of them of matter substantial for though many make books yet unneth ye shall in our english tongue find any works of cunning that is regarded by clerks the greeks the romans with many other mo in their mother tongue wrote warks excellent then if clerks in this realm would take pain so considering that our tongue is now sufficient to expound any hard sentence evident they might if they would in our english tongue write works of gravity sometime among for divers pregnant wits be in this land as well of noble men as of mean estate which nothing but english can understand then if cunning latin books were translate into english well correct and approbate all subtle science in english might be learned as well as other people in their own tongues did but now so it is that in our english tongue many one there is that can but read and write for his pleasure will oft presume among new books to compile and ballads to indite some of love or other matter not worth a mite some to obtain favour will flatter and glose some write curious terms nothing to purpose thus every man after his fantasy will write his conceit be it never so rude be it virtuous vicious wisdom or folly wherefore to my purpose thus i concludewhy should not then the author of this interlude utter his own fantasy and conceit also as well as divers other nowadays do for wisdom and folly is as it is taken for that the one calleth wisdom another calleth folly yet among most folk that man is holden most wise which to be rich studieth only but he that for a commonwealth busily studieth and laboureth and liveth by gods law except he wax rich men count him but a daw so he that is rich is ever honoured although he have got it never so falsely the poor being never so wise is reproved this is the opinion most commonly thoroughout the world and yet no reason why therefore in my mind when that all such daws have babbled what they can no force of two straws for every man in reason thus ought to do to labour for his own necessary living and then for the wealth of his neighbour also but what devilish mind have they which musing and labouring all their lives do no other thing but bring riches to their own possession nothing regarding their neighbours destruction yet all the riches in the world that is riseth of the ground by gods sending and by the labour of poor mens hands and though thou rich man have thereof the keeping yet is not this riches of thy getting nor oughtest not in reason to be praised the more for by other mens labour it is got before a greatwitted man may soon be enriched that laboureth and studieth for riches only but how shall his conscience then be dischargedfor all clerks affirm that that man precisely which studieth for his own wealth principally of god shall deserve but little reward except he the commonwealth somewhat regard so they say that that man occupied is for a commonwealth which is ever labouring to relieve poor people with temporal goods and that it is a common good act to bring people from vice and to use good living likewise for a commonwealth occupied is he that bringeth them to knowledge that ignorant be but man to know god is a difficulty except by a mean he himself inure which is to know gods creatures that be as first them that be of the grossest nature and then to know them that be more pure and so by little and little ascending to know gods creatures and marvellous working and this wise man at the last shall come to the knowledge of god and his high majesty and so to learn to do his duty and also to deserve of his goodness partner to be wherefore in this work declared shall ye see first of the elements the situation and of their effects the cause and generation and though some men think this matter too high and not meet for an audience unlearned methink for man nothing more necessary than this to know though it be not used nor a matter more low cannot be argued for though the elements gods creatures be yet they be most gross and lowest in degree how dare men presume to be called clerks disputing of high creatures celestialas things invisible and gods high warks and know not these visible things inferial so they would know high things and know nothing at all of the earth here whereon they daily be neither the nature form nor quantity wherefore it seemeth nothing convenient a man to study and his time to bestow first for the knowledge of high things excellent and of light matters beneath nothing to know as of these four elements here below whose effects daily appear here at eye such things to know first were most meet study which matter before your presence shortly in this interlude here shall be declared without great eloquence in rhyme rudely because the compiler is but small learned this work with rhetoric is not adorned for perhaps in this matter much eloquence should make it tedious or hurt the sentence but because some folk be little disposed to sadness but more to mirth and sport this philosophical work is mixed with merry conceits to give men comfort and occasion to cause them to resort to hear this matter whereto if they take heed some learning to them thereof may proceed but they that shall now this matter declare openly here unto this audience behold i pray you see where they are the players begin to appear in presence i see well it is time for me go hence and so i will do therefore now shortly to god i commit all this whole companyhic intrat natura naturata humanity and studious desire portans figuram natura naturata the high mighty most excellent of all the fountain of goodness virtue and cunning which is eterne of power most potential the perfection and first cause of everything i mean that only high nature naturing lo he by his goodness hath ordained and created me here his minister called nature naturate wherefore i am the very naturate nature the immediate minister for the preservation of everything in his kind to endure and cause of generation and corruption of that thing that is brought to destruction another thing still i bring forth again thus wondersly i work and never in vain the great world behold lo divided wondersly into two regions whereof one i call the ethereal region with the heavens high containing the planets stars and spheres all the lower region called the elemental containing these four elements below the fire the air the water and earth also but yet the elements and other bodies all beneath take their effects and operations of the bodies in the region ethereal by their influence and constellations they cause here corruptions and generations for if the movings above should once cease beneath should be neither increase nor decrease these elements of themselves so single be unto divers forms cannot be divided yet they commix together daily you seewhereof divers kinds of things be engendered which things eftsones when they be corrupted each element i reduce to his first estate so that nothing can be utterly annihilate for though the form and fashion of anything that is a corporal body be destroyed yet every matter remaineth in his being whereof it was first made and formed for corruption of a body commixed is but the resolution by time and space of every element to his own place for who that will take any body corporal and do what he can it to destroy to break it or grind it into powder small to wash to drown to bren it or to dry yet the air and fire thereof naturally to their own proper places will ascend the water to the water the earth to the earth tend for if heat or moisture of anything certain by fire or by water be consumed yet earth or ashes on earth will remain so the elements can never be destroyed for essentially there is now at this tide as much fire air water earth as was ever before this time neither more nor less wherefore thou mannow i speak to thee remember that thou art compound and create of these elements as other creatures be yet they have not all like noble estate for plants and herbs grow and be insensate brute beasts have memory and their wits five but thou hast all those and soul intellective so by reason of thine understanding thou hast dominion of other beasts alland naturally thou shouldst desire cunning to know strange effects and causes natural for he that studieth for the life bestial as voluptuous pleasure and bodily rest i account him never better than a beast humanity o excellent prince and great lord nature i am thine own child and formed instrument i beseech thy grace take me to thy cure and teach me such science thou thinkest expedient nature then sith thou art so humble and benevolent that thing that is meet for thy capacity and good for thy knowledge i shall instruct thee first of all thou must consider and see these elements which do each other penetrate and by continual alteration they be of themselves daily corrupted and generate the earth as a point or centre is situate in the midst of the world with the water joined with the air and fire round and whole environed the earth of itself is ponderous and heavy cold and dry of his own nature proper some part lieth dry continually and part thereof covered over with water some with the salt sea some with fresh river which earth and the water together withal so joined make a round figure spherical so the water which is cold and moist is found in and upon the earth filling the hollowness in divers parts lying with the earth round yet the hills and mountains of the earth excess take nothing of it away the roundnessin comparison because they be so small no more than the pricks do that be on a gall the air which is hot and moist also and the fire which is ever hot and dry about the earth and water jointly they go and compass them everywhere orbicularly as the white about the yoke of an egg doth lie but the air in the lower part most remaineth the fire naturally to the higher tendeth the ethereal region which containeth the stars and planets and every sphere about the elements daily moveth and covereth them round about everywhere every star and sphere in strange manner upon his own poles moveth diversely which now to declare were too long to tarry the fire and the air of their natures be light therefore they move by natural providence the water because it is ponderous in weight moveth not naturally but by violence of the stars and planets by whose influence the sea is compelled to ebb and flow daily and fresh waters to spring continually and though that the water be gross and heavy yet nothing so gross as the earth i wiss therefore by heat it is vapoured up lightly and in the air maketh clouds and mists but as soon as ever that it grossly is gathered together it descendeth again and causeth upon the earth hail snow and rain the earth because of his ponderosity avoideth equally the movings great of all extremities and spheres that beand tendeth to the place that is most quiet so in the midst of all the spheres is set foremost object from all manner moving where naturally he resteth and moveth nothing mark well now how i have thee showed and told of every element the very situation and quality wherefore this figure behold for a more manifest demonstration and because thou shouldst not put to oblivion my doctrine this man called studious desire with thee shall have continual habitation thee still to exhort more science to acquire for the more that thou desirest to know anything therein thou seemest the more a man to be for that man that desireth no manner cunning all that while no better than a beast is he why been the eyes made but only to see the legs to bear the body of a creature so everything is made to do his nature so likewise reason wit and understanding is given to thee man for that thou shouldst indeed know thy maker and cause of thine own being and what the world is and whereof thou dost proceed wherefore it behoveth thee of very need the cause of things first for to learn and then to know and laud the high god eterne humanity o glorious lord and prince most pleasant greatly am i now holden unto thee so to illumine my mind that was ignorant with such noble doctrine as thou hast here shown me wherefore i promise upon my fidelity my diligence to do to keep in memoryand thee for to honour still perpetually studious desire and sith it hath pleased thy grace to admit me upon this man to give attendance with thy doctrine here shown i shall quicken his wit and daily put him in remembrance his courage and desire i shall also enhance so that his felicity shall be most of all to study and to search for causes natural nature well then for a season i will depart leaving you together here both twain what i have shown man print well in thine heart and mark well this figure that here shall remain whereby thou mayest perceive many things more plain concerning the matter i spoke of before and when that i shall resort here again of high points of cunning i shall show thee more studious desire now humanity call to your memory the cunning points that nature hath declared and though he has shown divers points and many of the elements so wondersly formed yet many other causes there are would be learned as to know the generation of things all here in the earth how they be engendered as herbs plants wellsprings stone and metal humanity those things to know for me be full expedient but yet in those points which nature late showed me my mind in them as yet is not contentfor i can no manner wise perceive nor see nor prove by reason why the earth should be in the middes of the firmament hanging so small and the earth with the water to be round withal studious desire me thinketh myself as to some of those points i could give a sufficient solution for first of all thou must needs grant this that the earth is so deep and bottom hath none or else there is some gross thing it standeth upon or else that it hangeth thou must needs consent even in the middes of the firmament humanity what then go forth with thine argument studious desire then mark well in the day or in a winters night the sun and moon and stars celestial in the east first they do appear to thy sight and after in the west they do down fall and again in the morrow next of all within twentyfour hours they be come just to the east point again where thou sawest them first then if the earth should be of endless deepness or should stand upon any other gross thing it should be an impediment doubtless to the sun moon and stars in their moving therefore in reason it seemeth most convenient the earth to hang in the middes of the firmament humanity thine argument in that point doth me confound that thou hast made but yet it proveth not rightthat the earth by reason should be round for though the firmament with his stars bright compass about the earth each day and night yet the earth may be plane peradventure quadrant triangle or some other figure studious desire that it cannot be plane i shall well prove thee because the stars that arise in the orient appear more sooner to them that there be than to the other dwelling in the occident the eclipse is thereof a plain experiment of the sun or moon which when it doth fall is never one time of the day in places all yet the eclipse generally is alway in the whole world as one time being but when we that dwell here see it in the midday they in the west parts see it in the morning and they in the east behold it in the evening and why that should so be no cause can be found but only by reason that the earth is round humanity that reason proveth the earth at the least one ways to be round i cannot gainsay as for to account from the east to the west but yet notwithstanding all that it may lese his roundness by some other way studious desire nay no doubt it is round everywhere which i could prove thou shouldst not say nay if i had thereto any time and leisure but i know a man called experience of divers instruments is never withoutcould prove all these points and yet by his science can tell how many mile the earth is about and many other strange conclusions no doubt his instruments could show thee so certain that every rude carter should them perceive plain hu now would to god i had that man now here for the contemplation of my mind stu if ye will i shall for him inquire and bring him hither if i can him find hu then might i say ye were to me right kind stu i shall assay by god that me dear bought for cunning is the thing that would be

you be it for i am ready no man better willing exeat sen et hu intrat experiens et stu now cousin experience as i may sayye are right welcome to this country without any feigning ex sir i thank you thereof heartily and i am as glad of your company as any man living stu sir i understand that ye have been in many a strange country and have had great facility strange causes to seek and find ex right far sir i have ridden and gone and seen strange things many one in africa europe and india both east and west i have been far north also and seen the south star both by sea and land and been in sundry nations with people of divers conditions marvellous to understand stu sir if a man have such courage or devotion in pilgrimage jerusalem unto for to account the next way how many miles is it i you pray from hence thither to go ex sir as for all such questions of towns to know the situation how far they be asunder and other points of cosmography ye shall never learn them more surely than by that figure yonder for who that figure did first devise it seemeth well he was wise and perfect in this sciencefor both the sea and land also lie true and just as they should do i know by experience stu who think you brought here this figure ex i wot not stu certes lord nature himself not long agone which was here personally declaring high philosophy and laft this figure purposely for humanitys instruction ex doubtless right nobly done stu sir this realm you know is called england sometimes britain i understand therefore i pray you point with your hand in what place it should lie ex sir this is england lying here and that is scotland that joineth him near compassed about everywhere with the ocean sea around and next from them westwardly here by himself alone doth lie ireland that wholesome ground here then is the narrow sea to calais and boulogne the next way and flanders in this part here lieth france next him joining and spain southward from them standing and portugal in this quarter this country is called italy behold where rome in the midst doth lie and naples here beyond and this little sea that here is is called the gulf of veniceand here venice doth stand as for almaine lieth this way here lieth denmark and norway and northward on this side there lieth iceland where men doth fish but beyond that so cold it is no man may there abide this sea is called the great ocean so great it is that never man could tell it since the world began till now within this twenty years westward be found new lands that we never heard tell of before this by writing nor other means yet many now have been there and that country is so large of room much lenger than all christendom without fable or guile for divers mariners had it tried and sailed straight by the coast side above five thousand mile but what commodities be within no man can tell nor well imagine but yet not long ago some men of this country went by the kings noble consent it for to search to that intent and could not be brought thereto but they that were th adventurers have cause to curse their mariners false of promise and dissemblers that falsely them betrayed which would take no pains to sail farther than their own list and pleasurewherefore that voyage and divers other such caitiffs have destroyed oh what a thing had be then if that they that be englishmen might have been the first of all that there should have take possession and made first building and habitation a memory perpetual and also what an honourable thing both to the realm and to the king to have had his dominion extending there into so far a ground which the noble king of late memory the most wise prince the seventh herry caused first for to be found and what a great meritorious deed it were to have the people instructed to live more virtuously and to learn to know of men the manner and also to know god their maker which as yet live all beastly for they nother know god nor the devil nor never heard tell of heaven nor hell writing nor other scripture but yet in the stead of god almighty they honour the sun for his great light for that doth them great pleasure building nor house they have none at all but woods cots and caves small no marvel though it be so for they use no manner of iron neither in tool nor other weapon that should help them thereto copper they have which is foundin divers places above the ground yet they dig not therefore for as i said they have none iron whereby they should in the earth mine to search for any wore great abundance of woods there be most part fir and pineapple tree great riches might come thereby both pitch and tar and soap ashes as they make in the east lands by brenning thereof only fish they have so great plenty that in havens take and slain they be with staves withouten fail now frenchmen and other have found the trade that yearly of fish there they lade above a hundred sail but in the south part of that country the people there go naked alway the land is of so great heat and in the north part all the clothes that they wear is but beasts skins they have no nother fete but how the people first began in that country or whence they came for clerks it is a question other things mo i have in store that i could tell thereof but now no more till another season stu then at your pleasure show some other thing it liketh me so well your communing ye cannot talk amiss ex then will i turn again to my matterof cosmography where i was ere behold take heed to this lo eastward beyond the great ocean here entereth the sea called mediterranean of two thousand miles of length the soldans country lieth hereby the great turk on the north side doth lie a man of marvellous strength this said north part is called europa and this south part called africa this east part is called india but this new lands found lately been called america because only americus did first them find lo jerusalem lieth in this country and this beyond is the red sea that moses maketh of mention this quarter is india minor and this quarter india major the land of prester john but northward this way as ye see many other strange regions there be and people that we not know but eastward on the sea side a prince there is that ruleth wide called the can of catowe and this is called the great east sea which goeth all along this way towards the new lands again but whether that sea go thither directly or if any wilderness between them do lie no man knoweth for certain but these new lands by all cosmography from the can of catowes land cannot lielittle past a thousand miles but from those new lands men may sail plain eastward and come to england again where we began erewhile lo all this part of the earth which i have here descrived openly the north part we do it call but the south part on the other side is as large as this full and as wide which we know nothing at all nor whether the most part be land or sea nor whether the people that there be be bestial or cunning nor whether they know god or no nor how they believe nor what they do of this we know nothing lo is not this a thing wonderful how that et subito studious desire dicat stu peace sir no more of this matter behold where humanity cometh here sen how say you master humanity i pray you have ye not be merry and had good recreation hu yes i thank thee thereof every deal for we have fared marvellously well and had good communication ta what how master where be ye now sen what i shrew thee what haste hast thou that thou speakest so high ta so high quotha i trow ye be mad by st gile for did ye not erewhile make pointment openly to come again all to supper there as ye were today at dinnerand yet ye pointed not plain what meat that ye will have dressed nor what delicacies ye love best methink you far oversayne hu as for mine own part i care not dress what meat thou lovest spare not whatsoever thou dost best think ta now if ye put it to my liberty of all meats in the world that be by this light i love best drink sen it seemeth by thy face so to do but my master will have meat also whatsoever it cost ta by god sir then ye must tell what hu at thy discretion i force not whether it be sodden or roast ta well sir then care not let me alone ye shall see that all things shall be done and ordained well and fine hu so i require thee heartily and in any wise specially let us have a cup of new wine ta ye shall have wine as new as can be for i may tell you in privity it was brewed but yesternight hu but that is nothing for my delight ta but then i have for your appetite a cup of wine of old claret there is no better by this light hu well i trust thee well enou ta but one thing if it please you now ye see well i take much pain for you i trust ye will see to me hu yea i promise thee get thee henceand in this matter do thy diligence and i shall well reward thee sen because thou lookest for a reward one thing for thee i have prepared that here i shall thee give thou shalt have a knaves skin for to put thy body therein for term of thy life ta now gramercy my gentle brother and therefore thou shalt have another for voiding of strife sen now farewell gentle john ta then farewell fool for i am gone sen abide turn once again hark what i say yet there is another thing would do well at our masters washing hu what thing is that i thee pray sen marry thus canst thou tell us yet where is any rose water to get ta yea that i can well purvey as good as ever you put to your nose for there is a false wench called rose distilleth a quart every day sen by god i would a pint of that were poured even upon thy pate before all this presence ta yet i had liever she and i were both together secretly in some corner in the spence for by god it is a pretty girl it is a world to see her whirl dancing in a round o lord god how she will tripshe will bounce it she will whip yea clean above the ground hu well let all such matters pass i say and get thee hence and go thy way about this other matter ta then i go straight lo fare ye well sen but look yet thou remember every deal that i spake of full ere ta yes i warrant you do not fear exit taverner hu gods lord seest not who is here now what studious desire what news with you stu ye shall know sir ere i go sen what art thou here i see well i the mo knaves the worse company stu thy lewd conditions thou dost still occupy as thou art wont to do hu but i say who is this here in presence stu sir this is the man called experience that i spake of before hu experience why is this he sir ye are right welcome unto me and shall be evermore ex sir i thank you thereof heartily but i assure you faithfully i have small courage here to tarry as long as this man is here sen why whoreson what ailest at me ex for thou hast ever so lewd a property science to despise and yet thou art he that nought canst nor nought wilt learn sen marry avaunt knave i make god avow i think myself as cunning as thou and that shall i prove shortlyi shall put thee a question now come near let me see how well thou canst answer how spellest this word tom couper in true orthography ex tom couper quotha a wise question hardly sen yea i tell thee again yettom couper how spellest it lo he hath forgotten ye may see the first word of his a b c hark fool hark i will teach thee papaterterdo together tom couper is not this a sore matter lo here you see him proved a fool he had more need to go to school than to come hither to clatter stu certain this is a solution meet for such a boys question hu sensual appetite i pray thee let pass all trifles and vanity for a while it shall not long be and depart i thee require for i would talk a word or two with this man here ere he hence go for to satisfy my desire sen why gogs soul will ye so shortly break pointment with yonder company where you should come to supper i trust you will not break promise so hu i care not greatly if i do it is but a tavern matter sen then will i go show them what you say hu spare not if thou wilt go thy way for i will here tarry sen then adieu for a while i tell you plain but i promise you when i come againi shall make yonder knaves twain to repent and be sorry ex now i am full glad that he is gone stu so am i for good will he do none to no man living but this is the man with whom ye shall i trust be well content withal and glad of his coming for he hath expound cunningly divers points of cosmography in few words and short clause hu so i understand he hath good science and that he hath by plain experience learned many a strange cause stu yea sir and i say for my part he is the cunningest man in that art that ever i could find for ask what question ye will do how the earth is round or other mo he will satisfy your mind ex why what doubt have ye therein found think ye the earth should not be round or else how suppose ye hu one way it is round i must consent for this man proved it evident toward the east and occident it must needs round be ex and likewise from the south to north hu that point to prove were some thank worth ex yes that i can well prove for this ye know as well as i ye see the north star in the sky mark well ye shall unneth it spy that ever it doth removebut this i assure you if you go northward an hundredth mile or two ye shall think it riseth and how that it is near approached the point over the top of your head which is called your zenith yet if ye go the other way southward ten or twelve days journey ye shall then think anon it descended and come more nigh the circle parting the earth and sky as ye look straight with your eye which is called your horizon but ye may go southward so far that at the last that same star will seem so far down right clear underneath your horizon that sight thereof can you have none the earth will stop your sight this proveth of necessity that the earth must needs round be this conclusion doth it try hu now that is the properest conclusion that ever i heard for by reason no man may it deny but sir if that a man sail far upon the sea will then that star do there as on the ground ex yea doubtless sail northward rise it will and sail southward it falleth still and that proveth the sea round stu so doth it in mine opinion but know you any other conclusionto prove it round save that alone ex yea that i know right well as thus mark well when the sea is clear that no storm nor wave thereon doth ppear this mariners can tell then if a fire be made on night upon the shore that giveth great light and a ship in the sea far they in the top the fire see shall and they on hatch nothing at all yet they on hatches be near also on the sea where men be sailing far from land they see nothing but the water and the sky yet when they draw the land more near then the hilltops begin to appear still they near more high and high as though they were still growing fast out of the sea till at last when they come the shore to they see the hill top foot and all which thing so could not befal but the sea lay round also hu methinketh your argument somewhat hard ex then ye shall have it more plainly declared if ye have great desire for here lo by mine instruments i can show the plain experiments hu thereto i you require ex with all my heart it shall be done but for the first conclusion that i speak of the fire be this the sea that is so round and this the fire upon the groundand this the ship that is here you know well that a mans sight can never be but in a line right hu just you say that is clear ex mark well then may not that mans eye eight leaves are here wanting ignorance with arguing here their foolish saws that is not worth three straws i love not this whoreson losophers nor this great cunning extromers that tell how far it is to the stars i hate all manner cunning i would ye knew it i am ignorance a lord i am of greater puissance than the king of england or france yea the greatest lord living i have servants at my retinue that long to me i assure you herewith in england that with me ignorance dwell still and term of life continue will above five hundred thousand sen gogs nails i have paid some of them i trow ign why man what aileth thee so to blow sen for i was at a shrewd fray ign hast thou any of them slain then sen yea i have slain them every man save them that ran away ign why is any of them scaped and gone sen yea by gogs body every one all that ever were there ign why then they be not all slain sen no but i have put some to pain for one whoreson there was that turned againand straight i cut off his ear ign then thou hast made him a cutpurse sen yea but yet i served another worse i smote off his leg by the hard arse as soon as i met him there ign by my troth that was a mad deed thou shouldst have smit off his head then he should never have troubled thee more sen tush then i had been but mad for there was another man that had smit off his head before ign then thou hast quit thee like a tall knight sen yea that i have by this light but i say can you tell me right where became my master ign what he that you call humanity sen yea ign i wot never except he be hid here in some corner sen gogs body and true ye say for yonder lo behold ye may see where the mad fool doth lie ign now on my faith and truth it were even great alms to smite his head from his body sen nay god forbid ye should do so for he is but an innocent lo in manner of a fool for as soon as i speak to him again i shall turn his mind clean and make him follow my school ign then bid him rise let us hear him speak sen now rise up master huddypeke your tail toteth out behindfear not man stand up by and by i warrant you rise up boldly here is none but is your friend hu i cry you mercy master dear ign why what is cause thou hidest thee here hu for i was almost for fear even clean out of my mind sen nay it is the study that ye have had in this foolish losophy hath made you mad and no other thing iwis ign that is as true as the gospel therefore i have great marvel that ever thou wilt follow the counsel of yonder two knaves hu o sir ye know right well this that when any man is in other mens company he must needs follow the appetite of such things as they delight some time among perdy ign but such knaves would alway have thee to put all thy mind and felicity in this foolish cunning to study which if thou do will make thee mad and alway to be pensive and sad thou shalt never be merry sen merry quotha no i make god avow but i pray thee master hark one word now and answer this thing whether thought you it better cheer at the tavern where we were ere or else to clatter with these knaves here of their foolish cunninghu nay i cannot say the contrary but that i had mich merrier company at the tavern than in this place sen then if ye have any wit or brain let us go to the tavern again and make some merry solace ign if he will do so then doth he wisely hu by my troth i care not greatly for i am indifferent to all company whether it be here or there sen then i shall tell you what we will do master ignorance you and he also shall tarry both still here and i will go fet hither a company that ye shall hear them sing as sweetly as they were angels clear and yet i shall bring hither another sort of lusty bloods to make disport that shall both dance and spring and turn clean above the ground with friskas and with gambawds round that all the hall shall ring and that done within an hour or twain i shall at the town again prepare for you a banket of meats that be most delicate and most pleasant drinks and wines thereat that is possible to get which shall be in a chamber fair prepared pointdevice with damask water made so well that all the house thereof shall smell as it were paradise and after that if ye will toucha fair wench naked in a couch of a soft bed of down for to satisfy your wanton lust i shall appoint you a trull of trust not a fairer in this town and when ye have taken your delight and thus satisfied the appetite of your wits five ye may say then i am a servant for you so necessary and pleasant i trow none such alive hu now by the way that god did walk it comforteth mine heart to hear thee talk thy match was never seen ign then go thy way by and by and bring in this company and he and i will here tarry till thou come again hu and i pray thee heartily also sen at your request so shall i do lo i am gone now farewell i shall bring them into this hall and come myself foremost of all and of these revels be chief marshal and order all things well ign now set thy heart on a merry pin against these lusty bloods come in and drive fantasies away hu and so i will by heavens king if they either dance or sing have among them by this day ign then thou takest good and wise ways and so shalt thou best please all this whole companyfor the foolish arguing that thou hast had with that knave experience that hath made all these folk thereof weary for all that they be now in this hall they be the most part my servants all and love principally disports as dancing singing toys trifles laughing jesting for cunning they set not by hu i see well such company evermore as sensual appetite is gone for will please well this audience ign yea that i suppose they will but peace hark i pray thee be still i ween they be not far hence then the dancers without the hall sing this wise and they within answer or else they may say it for need the dancers and sensual peace sirs peace now peace sirs all humanity and ignorance why who is that so high doth call the dancers silence i say be you among for we be disposed to sing a song humanity and ignorance come in then boldly among this presence for here ye shall have good audience time to pass with goodly sport our sprites to revive and comfort to pipe to sing to dance to spring with pleasure and delightfollowing sensual appetite to pipe c ign i can you thank that is done well it is pity ye had not a minstrel for to augment your solace sen as for minstrel it maketh no force ye shall see me dance a course without a minstrel be it better or worse follow all i will lead a trace hu now have among you by this light ign that is well said by god almight make room sirs and give them place then he singeth this song and danceth withal and evermore maketh countenance according to the matter and all the others answer likewise dance we dance we prance we prance we so merrily let us dance ey so merrily c and i can dance it gingerly and i c and i can foot it by and by and i c and i can prank it properly and i can countenance comely and i can croak it courtesly and i can leap it lustily and i can turn it trimly and i can frisk it freshly and i can look it lordly ign i can thee thank sensual appetite that is the best dance without a pipe that i saw this seven year hu this dance would do mich better yet if we had a kit or taberet but alas there is none here sen then let us go to the tavern again there shall we be sure of one or twain of minstrels that can well playign then go i pray ye by and by and purvey some minstrel ready and he and i will follow shortly as fast as ever we may hu therewith i am right well content sen then will i go incontinent and prepare every thing that is metely to be done and for lack of minstrels the mean season now will we begin to sing now we will here begin to sing for dance can we no more for minstrels here be all lacking to the tavern we will therefore et exeunt cantando c hu now if that sensual appetite can find any good minstrels after his mind doubt not we shall have good sport ign and so shall we have for a surety but what shall we do now tell me the meanwhile for our comfort hu then let us some lusty ballad sing ign nay sir by the heaven king for methinketh it serveth for nothing all such peevish prickeared song hu peace man pricksong may not be despised for therewith god is well pleased honoured praised and served in the church ofttimes among ign is god well pleased trowst thou thereby nay nay for there is no reason why for is it not as good to say plainly give me a spade as give me a spa ve va ve va ve vadebut if thou wilt have a song that is good i have one of robin hood the best that ever was made hu then a fellowship let us hear it ign but there is a burden thou must bear it or else it will not be hu then begin and care not to down down down c

naturewell humanity now i see plainly that thou hast used much folly the while i have been absent hu sir i trust i have done nothing that should be contrary to your pleasing nor never was mine intent for i have followed the counsel clear as ye me bade of studious desire and for necessity among sometime sensual appetites counsel for without him ye know right well my life cannot endure long nature

elisaeus love and thine met sem what then cal why reprovest me then of ignorance sem for thou settest mans dignity in obeisance to the imperfection of the weak woman cal a woman nay a god of goddesses sem believest that then cal yea and as a goddess i here confess and i believe there is no such sovereign in heaven though she be in earth sem peace peace a woman a god nay to god a villain of your saying ye may be sorry cal it is plain sem why so cal because i love her and think surely to obtain my desire i am unworthy sem o fearful heart why comparest thou with nimrod or alexander of this

that they did overcome flee from their beginnings eschew their folly thou knowest they do evil things many they keep no mean but rigour of intention be it fair or foul wilful without reason keep them never so close they will be showed give tokens of love by many subtle ways seeming to be sheep and serpently shrewd craft in them renewing that never decays their sayings and sightings provoking their plays oh what pain is to fulfil their appetites and to accomplish their wanton delights it is a wonder to see their dissembling their flattering countenance their ingratitude inconstancy false witness feigned weeping their vainglory and how they can delude their foolishness their jangling not mewd their lecherous lust and vileness therefore witchcrafts and charms to make men to their lore their embalming and their unshamefacedness their bawdry their subtlety and fresh attiring what trimming what painting to make fairness their false intents and flickering smiling therefore lo it is an old

her godly grace her sovereign beauty perfit no tongue is able well to express it but yet i pray thee let me speak awhile myself to refresh in rehearsing of my style i begin at her hair which is so goodly crisped to her heels tied with fine lace far shining beyond fine gold of araby i trow the sun colour to it may give place that who to behold it might have the grace would say in comparison

crito and elicaea sat drinking in my house and i also making merry and as the devil would far from our thinking sempronio almost came on us suddenly but then wrought i my craft of bawdry i bade crito go up and make himself room to hide him in my chamber among the broom then made i elicaea sit down asewing and i with my rock began for to spin as who saith of sempronio we had no knowing he knocked at the door and i let him in and for a countenance i did begin to catch him in mine arms and said see see who kisseth me elicaea and will not kiss thee elicaea for a countenance made her grieved and

was which straking her body along on the grass and with her tail licked her so that she made herself a fair spaniel to be this bitch then methought met you in the wayleaping and fawning upon you apace and round about you did run and play which made you then disport and solace which liked you so well that in short space the way to the hot bath anon ye left it and took the straight way to the foul pit and ever ye looked continually upon that same bitch and so much her eyed that ye came to the foul pitbrink suddenly like to have fallen in and to have been destroyed which when i saw anon then i cried starting in my sleep and therewith did awake that yet for fear methink my body doth quake was not this a fearful dream and marvellous i pray you daughter what think ye now to this hic melibaea certo tempore non loquitur sed vultu lamentabili respicit why speak ye not why be ye now so studious is there anything that hath chanced you amiss i am your father tell me what it is mel alas now your dream which ye have expressed hath made me all pensive and sore abashed dan i pray you dear daughter now tell me why mel sir i know the cause of your vision and what your dreadful dream doth signify dan thereof would i fain now have knowlition mel alas dear father alas what have i done offended god as a wretch unworthy dan wherein despair not god is full of mercy et genuflectat mel then on my knees now i fall down and of god chiefly asking forgiveness and next of you for into oblivion i have put your doctrine and lessons doubtless dan fear not daughter i am not mercilessi trust ye have not so greatly offended but that right well it may be amended mel ye have fostered me up full lovingly in virtuous discipline which is the right path to all grace and virtue which doth signify by your dream the fair pleasant wholesome bath the foul pit whereof ye dreamed which hath destroyed so many betokeneth vice and sin in which alas i had almost fallen in the prickeared cur and the foul bitch which made herself so smooth and fair to see betokeneth an old quean a bawdy witch called celestina that woe might she be which with her fair words aye so persuaded me that she had almost brought me hereunto to fulfil the foul lust of calisto dan alas dear daughter i taught you a lesson which way ye should attain unto virtue that was every morning to say an orison praying god for grace all vice to eschew mel o dear father that lesson i have kept true which preserved me for though i did consent in mind yet had he never his intent dan the virtue of that prayer i see well one thing hath preserved you from the shame of that sin but because ye were somewhat consenting ye have offended god greatly therein wherefore daughter ye must now begin humbly to beseech god of his mercy for to forgive you your sin and misery mel o blessed lord and father celestial whose infinite mercy no tongue can express though i be a sinner wretch of wretches all yet of thy great mercy grant me forgivenessfull sore i repent my sin i confess intending henceforth never to offend more now humbly i beseech thy mercy therefore dan now that is well said mine own fair daughter stand up therefore for i know verily that god is good and merciful ever to all sinners which will ask mercy and be repentant and in will clearly to sin no more he of his great goodness will grant them therefore his grace and forgiveness lo here ye may see what a thing it is to bring up young people virtuously in good custom for grace doth never miss to them that use good prayers daily which hath preserved this maid undoubtedly and kept her from actual deed of shame brought her to grace preserved her good name wherefore ye virgins and fair maidens all unto this example now take good heed serve god daily the sooner ye shall to honesty and goodness no doubt proceed and god shall send you ever his grace at need to withstand all evil temptations that shall come to you by any occasions and ye fathers mothers and other which be rulers of young folks your charge is doubtless to bring them up virtuously and to see them occupied still in some good business not in idle pastime or unthriftiness but to teach them some art craft or learning whereby to be able to get their living the bringersup of youth in this region have done great harm because of their negligence not putting them to learning nor occupationsso when they have no craft nor science and come to mans state ye see the experience that many of them compelled be to beg or steal by very necessity but if there be therefore any remedy the heads and rulers must first be diligent to make good laws and execute them straitly upon such masters that be negligent alas we make no laws but punishment when men have offended but laws evermore would be made to prevent the cause before if the cause of the mischiefs were seen before which by conjecture to fall be most likely and good laws and ordinance made therefore to put away the cause that were best remedy what is the cause that there be so many thefts and robberies it is because men be driven thereto by need and poverty and what is the very cause of that need because they labour not for their living and truth is they cannot well labour indeed because in youth of their idle upbringing but this thing shall never come to reforming but the world continually shall be nought as long as young people be evil upbrought wherefore the eternal god that reigneth on high send his merciful grace and influence to all governors that they circumspectly may rule their inferiors by such prudence to bring them to virtue and due obedience and that they and we all by his great mercy may be partners of his blessed glory ameneveryman a moral play editions for a list of the editions see hazlitt ut infrâ a facsimile of the titlepage of one of the editions by skot is here given neither of the editions by pynson has the titlehawkinss preface this morality or moral play was published early in the reign of henry viii and is given from a blackletter copy preserved in the library of the church of lincoln it was communicated to the editor with the greatest politeness by the rev dr stinton chancellor of that church the design of it was to inculcate great reverence for old mother church and her popish superstitions as the most ingenious dr percy has given an analysis of this and the following moralities they are with his permission prefixed to the present editionthe subject of this piece is the summoning of man out of the world by death and its moral that nothing will then avail him but a wellspent life and the comforts of religion this subject and moral are opened in a monologue spoken by the messenger for that was the name generally given by our ancestors to the prologue on their rude stage then god is represented who after some general complaints on the degeneracy of mankind calls for death and orders him to bring before his tribunal everyman for so is called the personage who represents the human race everyman appears and receives the summons with all the marks of confusion and terror when death is withdrawn everyman applies for relief in this distress to fellowship kindred goods or riches but they successfully renounce and forsake him in this disconsolate state he betakes himself to good deeds who after upbraiding him with his long neglect of her introduces him to her sister knowledge and she leads him to the holy man confession who appoints him penance this he inflicts upon himself on the stage and then withdraws to receive the sacraments of the priest on his return he begins to wax faint and after strength beauty discretion and five wits have all taken their final leave of him gradually expires on the stage good deeds still accompanying him to the last then an angel descends to sing his requiem and the epilogue is spoken by a person called doctor who recapitulates the whole and delivers the moral doctor this moral men may have in mind ye hearers take it of worth old and young and forsake pride for he deceiveth you in the end and remember beauty five wits strength and discretion they all at the last do everyman forsake save his good deeds there doth he take but beware and they be small before god he hath no help at all from this short analysis it may be observed that everyman is a grave solemn piece not without some rude attempts to excite terror and pity and therefore may not improperly be referred to the class of tragedy it is remarkable that in this old simple drama the fable is conducted upon the strictest model of the greek tragedy the action is simply one the time of action is that of the performance the scene is never changed nor the stage ever empty everyman the hero of the piece after his first appearance never withdraws except when he goes out to receive the sacrament which could not well be exhibited in public and during this knowledge descants on the excellence and power of the priesthood somewhat after the manner of the greek chorus and indeed except in the circumstance of everymans expiring on the stage the samson agonistes of milton is hardly formed on a severer plan the woodcuts accompanying this and the succeeding piece hickescorner occur in the original editions by skot and presumably were also in those by pynsondramatis personae messenger knowledge god confession death beauty everyman strength fellowship discretion kindred five wits goods angel good deeds doctor illustration illustration here beginneth a treatise how the high father of heaven sendeth death to summon every creature to come and give account of their lives in this world and is in manner of a moral play messenger i pray you all give your audience and hear this matter with reverence by figure a moral play the summoning of everyman called it is that of our lives and ending shows how transitory we be all day this matter is wonders precious but the intent of it is more gracious and sweet to bear away the story saith man in the beginning look well and take good heed to the ending be you never so gay ye think sin in the beginning full sweet which in the end causeth thy soul to weep when the body lieth in clay here shall you see how fellowship and jollity both strength pleasure and beauty will fade from thee as flower in may for ye shall hear how our heaven king calleth everyman to a general reckoning give audience and hear what he doth say god speaketh i perceive here in my majesty how that all creatures be to me unkind living without dread in worldly prosperity of ghostly sight the people be so blind drowned in sin they knew me not for their god in worldly riches is all their mind they fear not my rightwiseness the sharp rod my law that i showed when i for them died they forget clean and shedding of my blood red i hanged between two it cannot be denied to get them life i suffered to be dead i healed their feet with thorns hurt was my head i could do no more than i did truly and now i see the people do clean forsake me they use the seven deadly sins damnable as pride covetise wrath and lechery now in the world be made commendableand thus they leave of angels the heavenly company every man liveth so after his own pleasure and yet of their life they be nothing sure i see the more that i them forbear the worse they be from year to year all that liveth appaireth fast therefore i will in all the haste have a reckoning of every mans person for and i leave the people thus alone in their life and wicked tempests verily they will become much worse than beasts for now one would by envy another up eat charity they do all clean forget i hoped well that every man in my glory should make his mansion and thereto i had them all elect but now i see like traitors deject they thank me not for the pleasure that i to them meant nor yet for their being that i them have lent i proffered the people great multitude of mercy and few there be that asketh it heartly

finishickscorner editions hyckescorner at the end enprynted by me wynkyn de worde black letter hycke scorner at the end thus endeth the enterlude of hycke scorner imprinted at london in foster laene by john waley black letterhickscorner this piece is printed from a black letter copy in mr garricks collection of which the following is a very accurate analysis extracted from dr percys relics of ancient english poetry vol i p hickscorner bears no distant resemblance to comedy its chief aim seems to be to exhibit characters and manners its plot being much less regular than the foregoing the prologue is spoken by pity represented under the character of an aged pilgrim he is joined by contemplation and perseverance two holy men who after lamenting the degeneracy of the age declare their resolution of stemming the torrent pity then is left upon the stage and presently found by freewill representing a lewd debauchee who with his dissolute companion imagination relate their manner of life and not without humour describe the stews and other places of base resort they are presently joined by hickscorner who is drawn as a libertine returned from travel and agreeably to his name scoffs at religion these three are described as extremely vicious who glory in every act of wickedness at length two of them quarrel and pity endeavours to part the fray on this they fall upon him and put him into the stocks and then leave him pity then descants in a kind of lyric measure on the profligacy of the age and in this situation is found by perseverance and contemplation who set him at liberty and advise him to go in search of the delinquents as soon as he is gone freewill appears again and after relating in a very comic manner some of his rogueries and escapes from justice is rebuked by the two holy men who after a long altercation at length convert him and his libertine companion imagination from their vicious course of life and then the play ends with a few verses from perseverance by way of epilogue it would be needless to point out the absurdities in the plan and conduct of the foregoing play they are evidently great it is sufficient to observe that bating the moral and religious reflections of pity c the piece is of a comic caste and contains a humorous display of some of the vices of the age indeed the author has generally been so little attentive to the allegory that we need only substitute other names to his personages and we have real characters and living manners the woodcuts prefixed to this and the foregoing play were very minutely traced and executed by a masterly hand and there being something singular in giving the portraits of the dramatis personae it is presumed the following will be particularly pleasing to the reader it appears to have been from this drama or interlude that the saying arose of hickscorners jests see mr jp colliers diary part iii p illustration illustrationhickscorner pity now jesu the gentle that brought adam fro hell save you all sovereigns and solace you send and of this matter that i begin to tell i pray you of audience till i have made an end for i say to you my name is pity that ever yet hath been

did stand when she saw her son on the rood the sword of sorrow gave that lady wound when a spear clave her sons heart asunder she cried out and fell to the ground though she was woe it was little wonder this delicate colour had that goodly lady full pale and wan she saw her son all dead splayed on a cross with the five wells of pity of purple velvet powdered with roses red lo i pity thus made your errand to be sped or else man for ever should have been forlore a maiden so laid his life to wed crowned as a king the thorns pricked him sore charity and i of true love leads the double rein

pardoner and the frere the curate and neybour pratte col imprynted by wyllyam rastell the v day of apryll the yere of our lorde mcccccxxxiii small folio this piece by john heywood differs from those which have preceded it it is destitute of the allegorical element and like some other productions which are to follow is a mere dramatic interlocution lightly and inartificially constructed with little or no plot a former editor remarks it was printed in but must have been written before because leo x is spoken of in it as livingthe pardoner and the friar the friar deus hic the holy trinity preserve all that now here be dear brethren if ye will consider the cause why i am come hither ye would be glad to know my intent for i come not hither for money nor for rent i come not hither for meat nor for meal but i come hither for your souls heal i come not hither to poll nor to shave i come not hither to beg nor to crave i come not hither to gloss nor to flatter i come not hither to babble nor to clatter i come not hither to fable nor to lie but i come hither your souls to edify for we friars are bound the people to teach the gospel of christ openly to preach as did the apostles by christ their master sent to turn the people and make them to repent but since the apostles from heaven would not come we friars now must occupy their room we friars are bound to search mens conscience we may not care for groats nor for pence we friars have professed wilful poverty no penny in our purse have may we knife nor staff may we none carry except we should from the gospel vary for worldly adversity may we be in no sorrow we may not care today for our meat tomorrow barefoot and barelegged must we go also we may not care for frost nor snow we may have no manner care ne think nother for our meat nor for our drink but let our thoughts fro such things be as free as be the birds that in the air flee for why our lord cleped sweet jesus in the gospel speaketh to us thus through all the world go ye saith he and to every creature speak ye of me and show of my doctrine and cunning and that they may be glad of your coming if that you enter in any house anywhere look that ye salute them and bid my peace be there and if that house be worthy and elect thilk peace there then shall take effect and if that house be cursed or pervert thilk peace then shall to yourself revert and furthermore if any such there be which do deny for to receive ye and do despise your doctrine and your lore at such a house tarry ye no more and from your shoes scrape away the dust to their reprefe and i both true and just shall vengeance take of their sinful deed wherefore my friends to this text take ye heedbeware how ye despise the poor freres which are in this world christs ministers but do them with an hearty cheer receive lest they happen your houses for to leave and then god will take vengeance in his ire wherefore i now that am a poor friar did inquire where any people were which were disposed the word of god to hear and as i came hither one did me tell that in this town right good folk did dwell which to hear the word of god would be glad and as soon as i thereof knowledge had i hither hied me as fast as i might intended by the grace of god almighty and by your patience and supportation here to make a simple collation wherefore i require all ye in this presence for to abide and give due audience but first of all now here i shall to god my prayer make to give ye grace all in this place his doctrine for to take and then kneeleth down the friar saying his prayers and in the meanwhile entereth the pardoner with all his relics to declare what each of them been and the whole power and virtue thereof the pardoner god and saint leonard send ye all his grace as many as been assembled in this place good devout people that here do assemble i pray god that ye may all well resemble the image after which you are wrought and that ye save that christ in you bought devout christian people ye shall all wit that i am comen hither ye to visit wherefore let us pray thus ere i begin our saviour preserve ye all from sin and enable ye to receive this blessed pardon which is the greatest under the sun granted by the pope in his bulls under lead which pardon ye shall find when ye are dead that offereth outher groats or else pence to these holy relics which ere i go hence i shall here show in open audience exhorting ye all to do to them reverence but first ye shall know well that i come from rome lo here my bulls all and some our liege lord seal here on my patent i bear with me my body to warrant that no man be so bold be he priest or clerk me to disturb of christs holy wark nor have no disdain nor yet scorn of these holy relics which saints have worn first here i show ye of a holy jews hip a bonei pray you take good keep to my words and mark them well if any of your beasts bellies do swell dip this bone in the water that he doth take into his body and the swelling shall slakeand if any worm have your beasts stung take of this water and wash his tongue and it will be whole anon and furthermore of pox and scabs and every sore he shall be quite whole that drinketh of the well that this bone is dipped in it is truth that i tell and if any man that any beast oweth once in the week ere that the cock croweth fasting will drink of this well a draught as that holy jew hath us taught his beasts and his stores shall multiply and masters all it helpeth well though a man be foul in jealous rage let a man with this water make his pottage and never more shall he his wife mistrist though he in sooth the fault by her wist or had she been taken with friars two or three here is a mitten eke as ye may see he that his hand will put in this mitten he shall have increase of his grain that he hath sown be it wheat or oats so that he offer pence or else groats and another holy relic eke here see ye may the blessed arm of sweet saint sunday and whosoever is blessed with this right hand cannot speed amiss by sea nor by land and if he offereth eke with good devotion he shall not fail to come to high promotion and another holy relic here may ye see the great toe of the holy trinity and whosoever once doth it in his mouth take he shall never be diseased with the toothache cancer nor pox shall there none breed this that i show ye is matter indeed and here is of our lady a relic full good her bongrace which she ware with her french hood when she went out always for sunburning women with child which be in mourning by virtue thereof shall be soon eased and of their travail full soon also released and if this bongrace they do devoutly kiss and offer thereto as their devotion is here is another relic eke a precious one of allhallows the blessed jaw bone which relic without any fail against poison chiefly doth prevail for whomsoever it toucheth without doubt all manner venom from him shall issue out so that it shall hurt no manner wight lo of this relic the great power and might which preserveth from poison every man lo of saint michael eke the brainpan which for the headache is a preservative to every man or beast that beareth life and further it shall stand him in better stead for his head shall never ache when that he is dead nor he shall feel no manner grief nor pain though with a sword one cleave it then atwain but be as one that lay in a dead sleep wherefore to these relics now come crouch and creep but look that ye offering to them make or else can ye no manner profit takebut one thing ye women all i warrant you if any wight be in this place now that hath done sin so horrible that she dare not for shame thereof shriven be or any woman be she young or old that hath made her husband cuckold such folk shall have no power nor no grace to offer to my relics in this place and whoso findeth herself out of such blame come hither to me on christs holy name and because ye shall unto me give credence at the full mine auctority now shall ye see lo here the popes bull now shall the friar begin his sermon and even at the same time the pardoner beginneth also to show and speak of his bulls and auctorities come from rome the friar date et dabitur vobis good devout people this place of scripture pardoner worshipful masters ye shall understand friar is to you that have no literature pardoner that pope leo the tenth hath granted with his hand friar is to say in our english tongue pardoner and by his bulls confirmed under lead friar as depart your goods the poor folk among pardoner to all manner people both quick and dead friarand god shall then give unto you again pardoner ten thousand years and as many lents of pardon friar this is the gospel so is written plain pardoner when they are dead their souls for to guardon friar therefore give your alms in the largest wise pardoner that will with their penny or alms deed friar keep not your goods fye fye on covetise pardoner put to their hands to the good speed friar that sin with god is most abhominable pardoner of the holy chapel of sweet saint leonard friar and is eke the sin that is most damnable pardoner which late by fire was destroyed and marred friar in scripture eke but i say sirs how pardoneray by the mass one cannot hear friar what a babbling maketh yonder fellow pardoner for the babbling of yonder foolish frere friar in scripture eke is there many a place pardoner and also masters as i was about to tell friar which showeth that many a man so farforth lacketh grace pardoner pope julius the sixth hath granted fair and well friar that when to them god hath abundance sent pardoner and doth twelve thousand years of pardon to them send friar they would distribute none to the indigent pardoner that ought to this holy chapel lend friar whereat god having great indignation pardoner pope boniface the ninth also friarpunished these men after a divers fashion pardoner pope julius pope innocent with divers popes mo friar as the gospel full nobly doth declare pardoner hath granted to the sustaining of the same friar how dives epulus reigning in welfare pardoner five thousand years of pardon to every of you by name friar and on his board dishes delicate pardoner and clean remission also of their sin friar poor lazarus came begging at his gate pardoner as often times as you put in friar desiring some food his hunger to relieve pardoner any money into the pardoners coffer friar but the rich man nothing would him give pardoneror any money up unto it offer friar not so much as a few crumbs of bread pardoner or he that offereth penny or groat friar wherefore poor lazarus of famine straight was dead pardoner or he that giveth the pardoner a new coat friar and angels his soul to heaven did carry pardoner or take of me other image or letter friar but now the rich man of the contrary pardoner whereby this poor chapel may fare the better friar when he was dead went to misery and pain pardoner and god wot it is a full gracious deed friar wherefore evermore he shall remain pardoner for which god shall quite you well your mede friarin brenning fire which shall never cease pardoner now help our poor chapel if it be your will friar but i say thou pardoner i bid thee hold thy peace pardoner and i say thou friar hold thy tongue still friar what standest thou there all the day smattering pardoner marry what standest thou there all the day clattering friar marry fellow i come hither to preach the word of god which of no man may be forbode but heard with silence and good intent for why it teacheth them evident the very way and path that shall them lead even to heavens gates as straight as any thread and he that letteth the word of god of audience standeth accursed in the great sentence and so art thou for interrupting me pardoner nay thou art a cursed knave and that shalt thou see and all such that to me make interruption the pope sends them excommunication by his bulls here ready to be read by bishops and his cardinals confirmed and eke if thou disturb me any thing thou art also a traitor to the king for here hath he granted me under his broad seal that no man if he love his heal should me disturb or let in any wise and if thou dost the kings commandment despise i shall make thee be set fast by the feet and where thou saidst that thou art more meet among the people here for to preach because thou dost them the very way teach how to come to heaven above therein thou liest and that shall i prove and by good reason i shall make thee bow and know that i am meeter than art thou for thou when thou hast taught them once the way thou carest not whether they come there yea or naybut when that thou hast done altogether and taught them the way for to come hither yet all that thou canst imagine is but to use virtue and abstain fro sin and if they fall once then thou canst no more thou canst not give them a salve for their sore but these my letters be clean purgation although never so many sins they have done but when thou hast taught them the way and all yet ere they come there they may have many a fall in the way ere that they come thither for why the way to heaven is very slidder but i will teach them after another rate for i shall bring them to heavens gate and be their guides and conduct all things and lead them thither by the pursestrings so that they shall not fall though that they would friar hold thy peace knave thou art very bold thou pratest in faith even like a pardoner pardoner why despisest thou the popes minister masters here i curse him openly and therewith warn all this whole company by the popes great auctority that ye leave him and harken unto me for till he be assoiled his words take none effect for out of holy church he is now clean reject friar my masters he doth but jest and rave it forceth not for the words of a knave but to the word of god do reverence and hear me forth with due audience masters i showed you ere while of almsdeed pardoner masters this pardon which i showed you before friar and how ye should give poor folk at their need pardoner is the greatest that ever was sith god was bore friar and if of your parts that thing once were donepardoner for why without confession or contrition friar doubt not but god should give you retribution pardoner by this shall ye have clean remission friar but now further it ought to be declared pardoner and forgiven of the sins seven friar who be these poor folk that should have your reward pardoner come to this pardon if ye will come to heaven friar who be those poor folk of whom i speak and name pardoner come to this pardon if ye will be in bliss friar certes we poor friars are the same pardoner this is the pardon which ye cannot miss friar we friars daily take pain i say pardoner this is the pardon which shall mens souls winfriar we friars daily do both fast and pray pardoner this is the pardon the ridder of your sin friar we friars travail and labour every hour pardoner this is the pardon that purchaseth all grace friar we friars take pain for the love of our saviour pardoner this is a pardon for all manner of trespass friar we friars also go on limitation pardoner this is the pardon of which all mercy doth spring friar for to preach to every christian nation pardoner this is the pardon that to heaven shall ye bring friar but i say thou pardoner thou wilt keep silence soon pardoner yea it is like to be when i have done friar marry therefore the more knave art thou i say that perturbest the word of god i sayfor neither thyself wilt hear gods doctrine ne suffer other their ears to incline wherefore our saviour in his holy scripture giveth thee thy judgment thou cursed creature speaking to thee after this manner maledictus qui audit verbum dei negligenter woe be that man saith our lord that giveth no audience or heareth the word of god with negligence pardoner now thou hast spoken all sir daw i care not for thee an old straw i had liever thou were hanged up with a rope than i that am come from the pope and thereby gods minister while thou standest and prate should be fain to knock without the gate therefore preach hardly thy bellyful but i nevertheless will declare the popes bull friar now my friends i have afore showed ye pardoner now my masters as i have afore declared friar that good it is to give your charity pardoner that pardoners from you may not be spared friar and further i have at length to you told pardoner now hereafter shall follow and ensue friar who be these people that ye receive should pardoner that followeth of pardons the great virtue friarthat is to say us friars poor pardoner we pardoners for your souls be as necessary friar that for our living must beg fro door to door pardoner as is the meat for our bodies hungry friar for of our own proper we have no proper thing pardoner for pardons is the thing that bringeth men to heaven friar but that we get of devout peoples giving pardoner pardons delivereth them fro the sins seven friar and in our place be friars three score and three pardoner pardons for every crime may dispense friar which only live on mens charity pardoner pardon purchaseth grace for all offence friar for we friars wilful charity profess pardoneryea though ye had slain both father and mother friar we may have no money nother more nor less pardoner and this pardon is chief above all other friar for worldly treasure we may nought care pardoner for who to it offereth groat or penny friar our souls must be rich and our bodies bare pardoner though sins he had done never so many friar and one thing i had almost left behind pardoner and though that he had all his kindred slain friar which before came not to my mind pardoner this pardon shall rid them from everlasting pain friar and doubtless it is none other thing pardoner there is no sin so abhominable friarbut when ye will give your alms and offering pardoner which to remit this pardon is not able friar look that ye distribute it wisely pardoner as well declareth the sentence of this letter friar not to every man that for it will cry pardoner ye cannot therefore bestow your money better friar for if ye give your alms in that wise pardoner let us not here stand idle all the day friar it shall not both to them and us suffice pardoner give us some money ere that we go our way friar but i say thou lewd fellow thou haddest none other time to show thy bulls but now canst not tarry and abide till soon and read them then when preaching is done pardoner i will read them now what sayest thou thereto hast thou anything therewith to do thinkest that i will stand and tarry for thy leisure am i bound to do so much for thy pleasure friarfor my pleasure nay i would thou knowest it well it becometh the knave never a deal to prate thus boldly in my presence and let the word of god of audience pardoner let the word of god quod a nay let a whoreson drivel prate here all day with a foul evil and all thy sermon goeth on covetise and biddest men beware of avarice and yet in thy sermon dost thou none other thing but for alms stand all the day begging friar leave thy railing i would thee advise pardoner nay leave thou thy babbling if thou be wise friar i would thou knowest it knave i will not leave a whit pardoner no more will i i do thee well to wit friar it is not thou shall make me hold my peace pardoner then speak on hardly if thou thinkest it for thy ease friar for i will speak whither thou wilt or no pardoner in faith i care not for i will speak also friar wherefore hardly let us both go to pardoner see which shall be better heard of us twofriar what should ye give ought to parting pardoners pardoner what should ye spend on these flattering liars friar what should ye give ought to these bold beggars pardoner as be these babbling monks and these friars friar let them hardly labour for their living pardoner which do nought daily but babble and lie friar it much hurteth them good mens giving pardoner and tell you fables dear enough at a fly friar for that maketh them idle and slothful to wark pardoner as doth this babbling friar here today friar that for none other thing they will cark pardoner drive him hence therefore in the twentydevil way friar hardly they would go both to plough and cartpardoner on us pardoners hardly do your cost friar and if of necessity once they felt the smart pardoner for why your money never can be lost friar but we friars be not in like estate pardoner for why there is in our fraternity friar for our hands with such things we may not maculate pardoner for all brethren and sistren that thereof be friar we friars be not in like condition pardoner devoutly song every year friar we may have no

the name of winken de worde as the printer of it he committed one of those singular oversights of which very learned men have before been sometimes guilty hickscorner perhaps the most ancient printed dramatic piece in our language and wellknown to those who are at all acquainted with the history of our stage was from his press and his colophon is at its conclusion enprynted by me wynkyn de worde mr dibdin in opposition to his own statement inserts it among the works of that early professor of the typographic art the subsequent dramatic production is also from the types of wynkyn de worde but it was not discovered in the library of trinity college dublin until after the appearance of the second volume of mr dibdinsnew edition of ames yet a copy was in the bibliotheca anglopoetica and in the piece was reprinted for the roxburghe club hickscorner is without date but the world and the child was printed in july only one other copy of it is known and it is here republished from a faithful

promises of god unto man by all ages in the old law from the fall of adam to the incarnation of the lord jesus christ compiled by john bale anno domini mdxxxviii in the word which is now called the eternal son of god was life from the beginning and that life was the light of men this light yet shineth in the darkness but the darkness comprehendeth it notjoan i black letter preface john bale author of the morality of gods promises is more known as an historian and controversialist than as a dramatic writer he was the son of henry and margaret bale and was born on the st of november at cove a small village near dunwich in suffolk his parents having many other children and not being in very affluent circumstances sent him at the age of twelve years to the monastery of carmelites at norwich where he received part of his education and whence he removed to jesus college cambridge while he continued at the university being as he says seriously stirred up by the illustrious the lord wentworth he renounced the tenets of the church of rome and that he might never more serve so execrable a beast i took says he to wife the faithful dorothy in obedience to that divine command let him that cannot contain marry bishop nicolson insinuates that his dislike to a state of celibacy was the means of his conversion more than any doubts which he entertained about the truth of his faith the change of his religion exposed him to the persecution of the romish clergy particularly of lee archbishop of york and stokesley bishop of london but he found an able and powerful protector in the person of lord cromwell the favourite of henry the eighth on the death of this nobleman he withdrew into the low countries and resided there eight years in which time he wrote several pieces in the english language on the accession of king edward the sixth he was recalled into england and obtained the living of bishopstoke in the county of southampton during his residence at his living he was almost brought to the point of death by an ague when hearing that the king was come in progress to southampton five miles only from where he dwelt he went to pay his respects to him i toke my horse says he about of the clocke for very weaknesse scant able to sytt him and so came thydre betwixt two and three of the clocke the same day i drew towardes the place where as his majestie was and stode in the open strete ryght against the gallerye anon my frinde johan fylpot a gentylman and one of hys previe chambre called unto him two more of hys companyons which in moving their heades towardes me shewed me most frendely countenaunces by one of these three the kynge havynge informacion that i was there in the strete he marveled thereof for so much as it had bene toldehym a lytle afore that i was bothe dead and buried with that hys grace came to the wyndowe and earnestly behelde me a poore weake creature as though he had upon me so symple a subject an earnest regard or rather a very fatherly care this visit to the king occasioned his immediate appointment to the bishopric of ossory which was settled the next day as he declared afterwards against his will of the kings own mere motion only without suit of friends meed labour expenses or any other sinister means else on the d february he was consecrated at dublin by the archbishop of that see and underwent a variety of persecutions from the popish party in ireland which at length compelled him to leave his diocese and conceal himself in dublin endeavouring to escape thence in a small trading vessel he was taken prisoner by the captain of a dutch manofwar who rifled him of all his money apparel and effects the ship was then driven by stress of weather into st ives in cornwall where he was taken up on suspicion of high treason but soon discharged from thence after a cruise of several days the ship arrived in dover road and he was again put in danger by a false accusation on his arrival in holland he was kept prisoner three weeks and then obtained his liberty on payment of a sum of money from holland he retired to basil in switzerland and continued abroad during the remainder of queen marys reign on the accession of queen elizabeth he returned to england but being disgusted with the treatment he met with in ireland he went thither no more he was promoted on the th of january to a prebend in the cathedral church of canterbury and died in that city in or before november in the sixtyeighth year of his age according to the manners of the times in which he wrote he appears to have taken very indecent liberties with all his antagonists in his religious controversies and to have considered himself as not bound by any rules of decorum in replying to those from whom he differed in matters wherein the interests of religion were concerned the acrimony of his style on these occasions acquired him the appellation of bilious bale and it was applied to him with singular propriety his principal work is esteemed the scriptorum illustrium majoris brytaniae quam nunc angliam et scotiam vocant catalogus a japheto per annos usque ad annum hunc domini c first printed imperfectly at wesel

edition in to in the valuable collection of david garrick esq the titlepage being damaged i am unable to give the date of it what is remarkable in this drama is that it is divided into seven acts and at the end of each act has a kind of chorus which was performed with voices and instrumentsinterlocutores pater coelestis adam primus homo justus noah abraham fidelis moses sanctus david rex pius esaias propheta joannes baptista baleus prolocutorgods promises baleus prolocutor if profit may grow most christian audience by knowledge of things which are not transitory and here for a time of much more congruence advantage might spring by the search of causes heavenly as those matters are that the gospel specify without whose knowledge no man to the truth can fall nor ever attain to the life perpetual for he that knoweth not the living god eternal the father the son and also the holy ghost and what christ suffered for redemption of us all what he commanded and taught in every coast and what he forbode that man must needs be lost and clean secluded from the faithful chosen sort in the heavens above to his most high discomfort you therefore good friends i lovingly exhort to weigh such matters as will be uttered here of whom ye may look to have no trifling sport in fantasies feigned nor suchlike gawdish gear but the things that shall your inward stomach cheer to rejoice in god for your justification and alone in christ to hope for your salvation yea first ye shall have the eternal generation of christ like as john in his first chapter writes and consequently of man the first creation the abuse and fall through his first oversight and the riseagain through gods high grace and might by promises first which shall be declared all then by his own son the worker principal after that adam bewaileth here his fall god will show mercy to every generation and to his kingdom of his great goodness call his elected spouse or faithful congregation as here shall appear by open protestation which from christs birth shall to his death conclude they come that thereof will show the certitude actus primus pater coelestis in the beginning before the heavens were create in me and of me was my son sempiternal with the holy ghost in one degree or estate of the high godhead to me the father coequal and this my son was with me one god essential without separation at any time from me true god he is of equal dignity since the beginning my son hath ever be joined with his father in one essential being all things were create by him in each degree in heaven and earth and have their diverse working without his power was never made anything that was wrought but through his ordinance each have his strength and whole countenancein him is the life and the just recoverance for adam and his which nought but death deserved and this life to men is an high perseverance or a light of faith whereby they shall be saved and this light shall shine among the people darkened with unfaithfulness yet shall they not with him take but of wilful heart his liberal grace forsake which will compel me against man for to make in my displeasure and send plagues of correction most grievous and sharp his wanton lusts to slake by water and fire by sickness and infection of pestilent sores molesting his complexion by troublous war by dearth and painful scarceness and after this life by an extreme heaviness i will first begin with adam for his lewdness which for an apple neglected my commandment he shall continue in labour for his rashness his only sweat shall provide his food and raiment yea yet must he have a greater punishment most terrible death shall bring him to his end to teach him how he his lord god shall offend hic praeceps in terram cadit adamus ac post

hazlitts handbook ppreface john heywood or heewood one of the most ancient dramatic writers in the english language was born in the city of london and educated in the university of oxford at broadgate afterwards called pembroke college in st aldgates parish he was in his time more celebrated for his wit than his learning and having some fair possessions at north mims he resided there after he left oxford and became intimately acquainted with sir thomas more who lived in that neighbourhood here the latter wrote his celebrated work called utopia and is supposed to have assisted heywood in the composition of his epigrams through sir thomas mores means it is probable our author was introduced to the knowledge of king henry the eighth and of his daughter the princess afterwards queen mary by the former of whom he was held in much esteem for the mirth and quickness of his conceits and so much valued by the latter that he was often after she came to the throne admitted to the honour of waiting upon and exercising his fancy before her even to the time she lay lauguishing on her deathbed his education having been in the roman catholic faith he continued steadily attached to the tenets of that religion and during the reign of edward the sixth fell under the suspicion of practising against the government and narrowly escaped the halter after the death of his patroness the queen he left the nation says wood for religions sake and settled at mechlin in brabrant where he appears to have been still living in january the exact date of his death is uncertain but he died leaving several children one of whom jasper heywood translated three of senecas plays and wrote several poems printed in the paradise of dainty devises to this jasper heywood was according to fuller executed in the reign of queen elizabeth but more probably as sir richard baker asserts was among those who were taken in and sent out of england john heywood was one of our earliest writers of a dramatic cast he can hardly be called a dramatist oldys says he began to write about the year but that he could not find he published anything so early his first production in point of date may have been the play of the pardoner and the frere printed april but two other interludes by him appeared the same year without note of the month they were perhaps all written a little before mr collier remarks of heywoods spider and fly this parable apologue or allegory for it is one and all three is not perhaps so dull tedious and trifling as warton contends and if it be without much fancy it has both meaning and moral in the conclusion heywood informs us that he began the work twenty years before it was finished and that he did nothing to it during an interval of nineteen years he adds that it was commenced with the first and ended with the last of his poor works the maid who sweeps down the spider he explains to mean queen mary in sense allegorical also wilson in his rhetorique published in speaks of heywoods proverbs as then in print they were also republished in and the titlepage professes that the work has been newly overseen and somewhat corrected by the sayde john heywood the only copy i have met with is imperfect at the end and the titlepage does not state who was the printer of it john heywoodes woorkes were printed collectively in they consist of proverbs and epigrams winstanley expressed a doubt whether the author of the epigrams and of the plays were not different persons the following epigram will be sufficient to set that fact beyond contradiction and at the same time exhibit a specimen of the authors manner art thou heywood with the mad mery wit ye forsooth master that same is euen hit art thou heywood that applyeth mirth more then thrift ye sir i take mery mirth a golden gift art thou heywood that hath made many mad plaies ye many playes fewe good woorkes in all my daies art thou heywood that hath made men mery long ye and will if i be made mery among art thou heywood that woulde be made mery now ye sir helpe me to it now i beseche yow winstanley and philips ascribe to him falsely the pinner of wakefield and philotus the latter printed at edinburgh fuller mentions a book written by our author entitled monumenta literaria which are said to be non tam lambore condita quam lepore condita but this was not by john heywood it is apparently thomas heywoods account of the english poets referred to by more than one of his contemporariesthe curious old relic here reprinted went through three known editions of which the earliest may be assigned to or thereabouts the latest bearing date the colophon of the former will be found at the end dramatis personae a palmer a pardoner an apothecary a pedlarthe four pp palmer now god be here who keepeth this place now by my faith i cry you mercy of reason i must sue for grace my rudeness showeth me so homely whereof your pardon axed and won i sue you as courtesy doth me bind to tell this which shall be begun in order as may come best in mind i am a palmer as ye see which of my life much part have spent in many a fair and far country as pilgrims do of good intent at jerusalem have i been before christs blessed sepulchre the mount of calvary have i seen a holy place you may be sure to jehosaphat and olivet on foot god wot i went right bare many a salt tear did i sweat before thy carcase could come there yet have i been at rome also and gone the stations all arow st peters shrine and many mo than if i told all ye do know except that there be any such that hath been there and diligently hath taken heed and marked much then can they speak as much as i then at the rhodes also i was and round about to amias at st uncumber and st trunnion at st botoph and st anne of buxton on the hills of armenia where i saw noes ark with holy job and st george in southwark at waltham and at walsingham and at the good rood of dagenham at saint cornelys at saint james in gales and at saint wenefrids well in wales at our lady of boston at saint edmunds burgh and straight to saint patricks purgatory at redburne and at the blood of hales where pilgrims pains right much avails at saint davids and at saint denis at saint matthew and saint mark in venice at master john shorn at canterbury the great god of catwade at king henry at saint saviours at our lady of southwell at crome at willesden and at muswell at saint richard and at saint rock and at our lady that standeth in the oak to these with other many one devoutly have i prayed and gone praying to them to pray for me unto the blessed trinity by whose prayers and my daily pain i trust the sooner to obtain for my salvation grace and mercy for be ye sure i think surelywho seeketh saints for christs sake and namely such as pain do take on foot to punish their frail body shall thereby merit more highly than by anything done by man pardoner and when ye have gone as far as ye can for all your labour and ghostly intent ye will come home as wise as ye went palmer why sir despised ye pilgrimage pardoner nay fore god sir then did i rage i think ye right well occupied to seek these saints on every side also your pain i not dispraise it but yet i discommend your wit and ere we go even so shall ye if you in this will answer me i pray you show what the cause is ye went all these pilgrimages palmer forsooth this life i did begin to rid the bondage of my sin for which these saints rehearsed ere this i have both sought and seen iwis beseeching them to bear record of all my pain unto the lord that giveth all remission upon each mans contrition and by their good mediation upon mine humble submission i trust to have in very deed for my soul health the better speed pardoner now is your own confession likely to make yourself a fool quickly for i perceive ye would obtain no other thing for all your pain but only grace your soul to save now mark in this what wit ye have to seek so far and help so nigh even here at home is remedy for at your door myself doth dwell who could have saved your soul as well as all your wide wandering shall do though ye went thrice to jericho now since ye might have sped at home what have ye won by running at rome palmer if this be true that ye have moved then is my wit indeed reproved but let us hear first what ye are pardoner truly i am a pardoner palmer truly a pardoner that may be true but a true pardoner doth not ensue right seldom is it seen or never that truth and pardoners dwell together for be your pardons never so great yet them to enlarge ye will not let with such lies that ofttimes christ wot ye seem to have that ye have notwherefore i went myself to the self thing in every place and without saying had as much pardon there assuredly as ye can promise me here doubtfully howbeit i think ye do but scoff but if ye had all the pardon ye speak of and no whit of pardon granted in any place where i have haunted yet of my labour i nothing repent god hath respect how each time is spent and as in his knowledge all is regarded so by his goodness all is rewarded pardoner by the first part of this last tale it seemeth ye came of late from the ale for reason on your side so far doth fail that ye leave reasoning and begin to rail wherein you forget your own part clearly for you be as untrue as i and in one point ye are beyond me for you may lie by authority and all that have wandered so far that no man can be their controller and where you esteem your labour so much i say yet again my pardons are such that if there were a thousand souls on a heap i would bring them to heaven as good cheap as ye have brought yourself on pilgrimage in the least quarter of your voyage which is far a side heaven by god there your labour and pardon is odd with small cost and without any pain these pardons bring them to heaven plain give me but a penny or two pence and as soon as the soul departeth hence in halfanhour or threequarters at the most the soul is in heaven with the holy ghost pothecary send ye any souls to heaven by water pardoner if we do sir what is the matter pothecary by god i have a dry soul should thither i pray you let our souls go to heaven together so busy you twain be in souls health may not a pothecary come in by stealth yes that i will by st anthony and by the leave of this company prove ye false knaves both ere we go in part of your sayings as this lo thou by thy travail thinkest heaven to get and thou by pardons and relics countest no let to send thine own soul to heaven sure and all other whom thou list to procure if i took an action then were they blank for like thieves the knaves rob away my thank all souls in heaven having relief shall they thank your crafts nay thank mine chief no soul ye know entereth heavengate till from the body he be separate and whom have ye known die honestly without help of the pothecary nay all that cometh to our handlingexcept ye happen to come to hanging that way perchance ye shall not mister to go to heaven without a glister but be ye sure i would be woe if ye should chance to beguile me so as good to lie with me anight as hang abroad in the moonlight there is no choice to flee my hand but as i said into the band since of our souls the multitude i send to heaven when all is viewed who should but i then altogether have thank of all their coming thither pardoner if ye killed a thousand in an hours space when come they to heaven dying out of grace pothecary if a thousand pardons about your necks were tied when come they to heaven if they never died palmer long life after good works indeed doth hinder mans receipt of mead and death before one duty done may make us think we die too soon yet better tarry a thing than have it than go too soon and vainly crave it pardoner the longer ye dwell in communication the less shall ye like this imagination for ye may perceive even at the first chop your tale is trapped in such a stop that at the least ye seem worse than we pothecary by the mass i hold us nought all three enter pedlar pedlar by our lady then have i gone wrong and yet to be here i thought it long pothecary ye have gone wrong no whit i praise your fortune and your wit that can direct you so discreetly to plant you in this company thou a palmer and thou a pardoner i a pothecary pedlar and i a pedlar pothecary now on my faith well watched where the devil were we four hatched pedlar that maketh no matter since we be matched i could be merry if that i had catched some money for part of the ware in my pack pothecary what the devil hast thou there at thy back pedlar what dost thou not know that every pedlar in all kind of trifles must be a meddler specially in womens triflings those use we chiefly above all things which things to see if ye be disposed behold what ware here is disclosedthis gear showeth itself in such beauty that each man thinketh it saith come buy me look where yourself can like to be chooser yourself shall make price though i be loser is here nothing for my father palmer have ye not a wanton in a corner for all your walking to holy places by christ i have heard of as strange cases who liveth in love and love would win even at this pack he must begin wherein is right many a proper token of which by name part shall be spoken gloves pins combs glasses unspotted pomades hooks and laces knotted brooches rings and all manner of beads laces round and flat for womens heads needles thread thimble shears and all such knacks where lovers be no such things lacks sipers swathbands ribbons and sleeve laces girdles knives purses and pincases pothecary do women buy their pincases of you pedlar yea that they do i make god a vow pothecary so mot i thrive then for my part i beshrew thy knaves naked heart for making my wifes pincase so wide the pins fall out they cannot abide great pins she must have one or other if she lose one she will find another wherein i find cause to complain new pins to her pleasure and to my pain pardoner sir ye seem wellseen in womens causes i pray you tell me what causeth this that women after their arising be so long in their apparelling pedlar forsooth women have many lets and they be masked in many nets as frontlets fillets partlets and bracelets and then their bonnets and their poignets by these lets and nets the let is such that speed is small when haste is much pothecary another cause why they come not forward which maketh them daily to draw backward and yet is a thing they cannot forbear the trimming and pinning up their gear specially their fiddling with the tailpin and when they would have it pricked in if it chance to double in the cloth then be they wood and sweareth an oath till it stand right they will not forsake it thus though it may not yet would they make it but be ye sure they do but defer it for when they would make it oft times mar it but prick them and pin them as nice as ye will and yet will they look for pinning still so that i durst hold with you a joint ye shall never have them at a full pointpedlar let womens matters pass and mark mine whatever their points be these points be fine wherefore if ye be willing to buy lay down money come off quickly palmer nay by my troth we be like friars we are but beggars we be no buyers pardoner sir ye may show your ware for your mind but i think ye shall no profit find pedlar well though this journey acquit no cost yet think i not my labour lost for by the faith of my body i like full well this company up shall this pack for it is plain i came not hither all for gain who may not play one day in a week may think his thrift is far to seek devise what pastime that ye think best and make ye sure to find me prest pothecary why be ye so universal that ye can do whatsoever ye shall pedlar sir if ye list for to oppose me what i can do then shall you see pothecary then tell me this are you perfit in drinking pedlar perfit in drinking as may be wished by thinking pothecary then after your drinking how fall ye to winking pedlar sir after drinking while the shot is tinking some heads be swimming but mine will be sinking and upon drinking my eyes will be pinking for winking to drinking is alway linking pothecary then drink and sleep you can well do but if ye were desired thereto i pray you tell me can you sing pedlar sir i have some sight in singing pothecary but is your breast any thing sweet pedlar whatever my breast be my voice is meet pothecary that answer showeth you a right singing man now what is your will good father then palmer what helpeth will where is no skill pardoner and what helpeth skill where is no will pothecary for will or skill what helpeth it where forward knave be lacking wit leave off this curiosity and who that list sing after me here they sing pedlar this liketh me well so mot i the pardoner so help me god it liketh not me where company is met and well agreedgood pastime doth right well indeed but who can sit in daliance men sit in such a variance as we were set ere ye came in which strife this man did first begin alleging that such men as use for love of god and not refuse on foot to go from place to place a pilgrimage calling for grace shall in that pain with penitence obtain discharge of conscience comparing that life for the best induction to your endless rest upon these words our matter grew for if he could avow them true as good to be a gardener as for to be a pardoner but when i heard him so far wide i then approached and replied saying this that this indulgence having the foresaid penitence dischargeth man of all offence with much more profit than this pretence i ask but twopence at the most iwis this is not very great cost and from all pain without despair my soul for to keep even in his chair and when he dieth he may be sure to come to heaven even at pleasure and more than heaven he cannot get how far soever he list to jet then is his pain more than his wit to walk to heaven since he may sit sir as we were in this contention in came this daw with his invention reviling us himself avaunting that all the souls to heaven ascending are most bound to the pothecary because he helpeth most men to die before which death he saith indeed no soul in heaven can have his mede pedlar why do pothecaries kill men pothecary by god men say so now and then pedlar and i thought ye would not have mit to make them live as long as ye list pothecary as long as we list nay as long as they can pedlar so might we live without you then pothecary yea but yet it is necessary for to have a pothecary for when ye feel your conscience ready i can send you to heaven quickly wherefore concerning our matter here above these twain i am best clear and if ye list to take me so i am content you and no mo shall be our judge as in this case which of us three shall take the best placepedlar i neither will judge thee best nor worst for be ye blest or be ye curst ye know it is no whit my sleight to be a judge in matters of weight it behoveth no pedlars nor proctors to take on them judgment as doctors but if your minds be only set to work for soulhealth ye be well met for each of you somewhat doth show that souls toward heaven by you do grow then if ye can so well agree to continue together all three and all you three obey one will then all your minds ye may fulfil as if ye came all to one man who should go pilgrimage more than he can in that ye palmer as deputy may clearly discharge him parde and for all other sins once had contrition your pardons giveth him full remission and then ye master pothecary may send him to heaven by and by pothecary if he taste this box nigh about the prime by the mass he is in heaven ere evensong time my craft is such that i can right well send my friends to heaven and myself to hell but sirs mark this man for he is wise who could devise such a device for if we three may be as one then be we lords everychone between us all could not be mist to save the souls of whom we list but for good order at a word twain of us must wait on the third pothecary and unto that i do agree for both you twain shall wait on me pardoner what chance is this that such an elf command two knaves beside himself nay nay my friend that will not be i am too good to wait on thee palmer by our lady and i would be loth to wait on the better of you both pedlar yet be ye sure for all this doubt this waiting must be brought about men cannot prosper wilfufly led all things decay where is no head wherefore doubtless mark what i say to one of you three twain must obey and since ye cannot agree in voice who shall be head there is no choice but to devise some manner thing wherein ye all be like conning and in the same who can do best the other twain do make them prest in every thing of his intent wholly to be at commandment and now have i found one mastery that ye can do indifferentlyand is nother selling nor buying but even on very lying and all ye three can lie as well as can the falsest devil in hell and though afore ye heard me grudge in greater matters to be your judge yet in lying i can some skill and if i shall be judge i will and be you sure without flattery where my conscience findeth the mastery there shall my judgment straight be found though i might win a thousand pound palmer sir for lying though i can do it yet am i both for to go to it pedlar ye have no cause for fear be bold for ye may here lie uncontrolled and ye in this have good advantage for lying is your common usage and you in lying be well sped for all your craft doth stand in falsehood ye need not care who shall begin for each of you may hope to win now speak all three even as ye find be ye agreed to follow my mind palmer yea by my troth i am content pardoner now in good faith and i assent pothecary if i denied i were a noddy for all is mine by gods body here the pothecary hoppeth palmer here were a hopper to hop for the ring but sir this gear goeth not by hopping pothecary sir in this hopping i will hop so well that my tongue shall hop better than my heel upon which hopping i hope and not doubt it to hop so that ye shall hop without it palmer sir i will neither boast ne brawl but take such fortune as may fall and if ye win this mastery i will obey you quietly and sure i think that quietness in any man is great riches in any manner company to rule or be ruled indifferently pardoner by that boast thou seemest a beggar indeed what can thy quietness help us at need if we should starve thou hast not i think one penny to buy us one pot of drink nay if riches might rule the roost behold what cause i have to boast lo here be pardons half a dozen for ghostly riches they have no cousin and moreover to me they bring sufficient succour for my living and here be relics of such a kind as in this world no man can find kneel down all three and when ye leave kissing who list to offer shall have my blessingfriends here shall ye see even anon of allhallows the blessed jawbone kiss it hardily with good devotion pothecary this kiss shall bring us much promotion foh by st saviour i never kissed a worse ye were as good kiss allhallows arse for by allhallows yet methinketh that allhallows breath stinketh palmer ye judge allhallows breath unknown if any breath stink it is your own pothecary i know mine own breath from allhallows or else it were time to kiss the gallows pardoner nay sirs behold here may ye see the great toe of the trinity who to this toe any money voweth and once may roll it in his mouth all his life after i undertake he shall never be vexed with the toothache pothecary i pray you turn that relic about either the trinity had the gout or else because it is three toes in one god made it as much as three toes alone pardoner well let that pass and look upon this here is a relic that doth not miss to help the least as well as the most this is a buttockbone of pentecost pothecary by christ and yet for all your boast this relic hath beshitten the roast pardoner mark well this relic here is a whipper my friends unfeigned here is a slipper of one of the seven sleepers be sure doubtless this kiss shall do you great pleasure for all these two days it shall so ease you that none other savours shall displease you pothecary all these two days nay all these two years for all the savours that may come here can be no worse for at a word one of the seven sleepers trod in a turd pedlar sir methinketh your devotion is but small pardoner small marry methinketh he hath none at all pothecary what the devil care i what ye think shall i praise relics when they stink pardoner here is an eyetooth of the great turk whose eyes be once set on this piece of work may happily lese part of his eyesight but not till he be blind outright pothecary whatsoever any other man seeth i have no devotion unto turks teeth for although i never saw a greater yet methinketh i have seen many betterpardoner here is a box full of humble bees that stang eve as she sat on her knees tasting the fruit to her forbidden who kisseth the bees within this hidden shall have as much pardon of right as for any relic he kissed this night palmer sir i will kiss them with all my heart pothecary kiss them again and take my part for i am not worthy nay let be those bees that stung eve shall not sting me pardoner good friends i have yet here in this glass which on the drink at the wedding was of adam and eve undoubtedly if ye honour this relic devoutly although ye thirst no whit the less yet shall ye drink the more doubtless after which drinking ye shall be as meet to stand on your head as on your feet pothecary yea marry now i can you thank in presence of thisthe rest be blank would god this relic had come rather kiss that relic well good father such is the pain that ye palmers take to kiss the pardonbowl for the drink sake o holy yeast that looketh full sour and stale for gods body help me to a cup of ale the more i behold thee the more i thirst the oftener i kiss thee the more like to burst but since i kiss thee so devoutly hire me and help me with drink till i die what so much praying and so little speed pardoner yea for god knoweth when it is need to send folks drink but by st anthony i ween he hath sent you too much already pothecary if i have never the more for thee then be thy relics no riches to me nor to thyself except they be more beneficial than i can see richer is one box of this triacle than all thy relics that do no miracle if thou hadst prayed but half so much to me as i have prayed to thy relics and thee nothing concerning mine occupation but straight should have wrought one operation and as in value i pass you an ace so here lieth much richness in little space i have a box of rhubarb here which is as dainty as it is dear so help me god and halidom of this i would not give a dram to the best friend i have in englands ground though he would give me twenty pound for though the stomach do it abhor it purgeth you clean from the choler and maketh your stomach sore to walter that ye shall never come to the halterpedlar then is that medicine a sovereign thing to preserve a man from hanging pothecary if ye will taste but this crumb that ye see if ever ye be hanged never trust me here have i diapompholicus a special ointment as doctors discuss for a fistula or for a canker this ointment is even shotanchor for this medicine helpeth one and other or bringeth them in case that they need no other here is a syrapus de byzansis a little thing is enough of this for even the weight of one scruple shall make you as strong as a cripple here are others as diosfialios diagalanga and sticados blanka manna diospoliticon mercury sublime and metridaticon pellitory and arsefetita cassy and colloquintita these be the things that break all strife between mans sickness and his life from all pain these shall you deliver and set you even at rest for ever here is a medicine no mo like the same which commonly is called thus by name alikakabus or alkakengy a goodly thing for dogs that be mangy such be these medicines that i can help a dog as well as a man not one thing here particularly but worketh universally for it doth me as much good when i sell it as all the buyers that taste it or smell it now since my medicines be so special and in one operation so general and ready to work whensoever they shall so that in riches i am principal if any reward may entreat ye i beseech your maship be good to me and ye shall have a box of marmalade so fine that you may dig it with a spade pedlar sir i thank you but your reward is not the thing that i regard i must and will be indifferent wherefore proceed in your intent pothecary now if i wist this wish no sin i would to god i might begin pardoner i am content that thou lie first palmer even so am i now say thy worst now let us hear of all thy lies the greatest lie thou mayst devise and in the fewest words thou can pothecary forsooth ye be an honest man pedlar there said ye much but yet no lie pardoner now lie ye both by our ladythou liest in boast of his honesty and he hath lied in affirming thee pothecary if we both he and ye say true then of these lies your part adieu and if ye win make none avaunt for you are sure of one ill servant you may perceive by the words he gave he taketh your maship but for knave but who told truth or lied indeed that will i know ere we proceed sir after that i first began to praise you for an honest man when ye affirmed it for no lie now by your faith speak even truly thought ye your affirmation true palmer yea marry for i would ye knew i think myself an honest man pothecary what thought ye in the contrary then pardoner in that i said the contrary i think from truth i did not vary pothecary and what of my words pardoner i thought ye lied pothecary and so thought i by god that died now have you twain each for himself laid that none hath lied but both true said and of us twain none hath denied but both affirmed that i have lied now since both ye the truth confess how that i lied do bear witness that twain of us may soon agree and that the lier the winner must be who could provide such evidence as i have done in this pretence methinketh this matter sufficient to cause you to give judgment and to give me the mastery for ye perceive these knaves cannot lie palmer though nother of us yet had lied yet what we can do is untried for as yet we have devised nothing but answered you and given you hearing pedlar therefore i have devised one way whereby all three your minds may say for each of you one tale shall tell and which of you telleth most marvèl and most unlikest to be true shall most prevail whatever ensue pothecary if ye be set on marvelling then shall ye hear a marvellous thing and though indeed all be not true yet sure the most part shall be new i did a cure no longer ago but in anno domini millesimo on a woman young and so fairthat never have i seen a gayer god save all women of that likeness this wanton had the falling sickness which by descent came lineally for her mother had it naturally wherefore this woman to recure it was more hard ye may be sure but though i boast my craft is such that in such things i can do much how oft she fell were much to report but her head so giddy and her belly so short that with the twinkling of an eye down would she fall even by and by but ere she would arise again i showed much practice much to my pain for the tallest man within this town could not with ease have broken her swoon although for life i did not doubt her yet i did take more pains about her than i would take with my own sister sir at the last i gave her a glister i thrust a tampion in her tewell and bade her keep it for a jewel but i knew there it was too heavy to carry that i sure was it would not tarry for where gunpowder is once fired the tampion will no lenger be hired which was well seen in time of this chance for when i had charged this ordnance suddenly as it had thundered even at a clap loosed her bombard now mark for here beginneth the revel this tampion flew ten long mile level to a fair castle of lime and stone for strength i know not such a one which stood upon a hill full high at foot whereof a river ran by so deep till chance had it forbidden well might the regent there have ridden but when this tampion at this castle did light it put the castle so fair to flight that down they came each upon other no stone left standing by gods mother but rolled down so fast the hill in such a number and so did fill from bottom to brim from shore to shore this foresaid river so deep before that who list now to walk thereto may wade it over and wet no shoe so was this castle laid wide open that every man might see the token but in a good hour may these words be spoken after the tampion on the walls was wroken and piece by piece in pieces broken and she delivered with such violence of all her inconvenience i left her in good health and lust and so she doth continue i trust pedlar sir in your cure i can nothing tell but to your purpose ye have said well pardoner well sir then mark what i can sayi have been a pardoner many a day and done greater cures ghostly than ever he did bodily namely this one which ye shall hear of one departed within this seven year a friend of mine and likewise i to her again was as friendly who fell so sick so suddenly that dead she was even by and by and never spake with priest nor clerk nor had no whit of this holy work for i was thence it could not be yet heard i say she asked for me but when i bethought me how this chanced and that i have to heaven avanced so many souls to me but strangers and could not keep my friend from dangers but she to die so dangerously for her soulhealth especially that was the thing that grieved me so that nothing could release my woe till i had tried even out of hand in what estate her soul did stand for which trial short tale to make i took this journey for her sake give ear for here beginneth the story from hence i went to purgatory and took with me this gear in my fist whereby i may do there what i list i knocked and was let in quickly but lord how low the souls made curtesy and i to every soul again did give a beck them to retain and asked them this question then if that the soul of such a woman did late among them there appear whereto they said she came not here then feared i much it was not well alas thought i she is in hell for with her life i was so acquainted that sure i thought she was not sainted with this it chanced me to sneeze christ help quoth a soul that lay for his fees those words quoth i thou shalt not lese then with these pardons of all degrees i paid his toll and set him so quit that straight to heaven he took his flight and i from thence to hell that night to help this woman if i might not as who saith by authority but by the way of entreaty and first to the devil that kept the gate i came and spake after this rate all hail sir devil and made low curtesy welcome quoth he thus smilingly he knew me well and i at last remembered him since long time past for as good hap would have it chance this devil and i were of old acquaintance for oft in the play of corpus christi he hath played the devil at coventry by his acquaintance and my behaviourhe showed to me right friendly favour and to make my return the shorter i said to this devil good master porter for all old love if it lie in your power help me to speak with my lord and your be sure quoth he no tongue can tell what time thou couldst have come so well for as on this day lucifer fell which is our festival in hell nothing unreasonable craved this day that shall in hell have any nay but yet beware thou come not in till time thou may thy passport win wherefore stand still and i will wit if i can get thy safeconduit he tarried not but shortly got it under seal and the devils hand at it in ample wise as ye shall hear thus it began lucifer by the power of god chief devil of hell to all the devils that there do dwell and every of them we send greeting under strait charge and commanding that they aiding and assistant be to such a pardoner and named me so that he may at liberty pass safe without any jeopardy till that he be from us extinct and clearly out of hells precinct and his pardon to keep in safeguard we will they lie in the porters ward given in the furnace of our palace in our high court of matters of malice such a day and year of our reign god save the devil quoth i amain i trust this writing to be sure then put thy trust quod he in ure since thou art sure to take no harm this devil and i walked arm in arm so far till he had brought me thither where all the devils of hell together stood in array in such apparel as for that day there meetly fell their horns wellgilt their claws full clean their tails wellkempt and as i ween with sothery butter their bodies annointed i never saw devils so well appointed the masterdevil sat in his jacket and all the souls were playing at racket none other rackets they had in hand save every soul a good firebrand wherewith they played so prettily that lucifer laughed merrily and all the residue of the fiends did laugh thereat full well like friends but of my friend i saw no whit nor durst not ask for her as yet anon all this rout was brought in silence and i by an usher brought in presence of lucifer then low as well i could i kneeled which he so well allowed that thus he becked and by st anthonyhe smiled on me wellfavouredly bending his brows as broad as barndoors shaking his ears as rugged as burrs rolling his eyes as round as two bushels flashing the fire out of his nosthrils gnashing his teeth so vaingloriously that methought time to fall to flattery wherewith i told as i shall tell o pleasant picture o prince of hell feutred in fashion abhominable and since that is inestimable for me to praise thee worthily i leave of praise as unworthy to give thee praise beseeching thee to hear my suit and then to be so good to grant the thing i crave and to be short this would i have the soul of one which hither is flitted delivered hence and to me remitted and in this doing though all be not quit yet in some part i shall deserve it as thus i am a pardoner and over souls as controller thorough out the earth my power doth stand where many a soul lieth on my hand that speed in matters as i use them as i receive them or refuse them whereby what time thy pleasure is i shall requite any part of this the least devil here that can come thither shall choose a soul and bring him hither ho ho quoth the devil we are well pleased what is his name thou wouldst have eased nay quoth i be it good or evil my coming is for a she devil what callst her quoth he thou whoreson forsooth quoth i margery corson now by our honour said lucifer no devil in hell shall withhold her and if thou wouldest have twenty mo wert not for justice they should go for all we devils within this den have more to do with two women than with all the charge we have beside wherefore if thou our friend will be tried apply thy pardons to women so that unto us there come no mo to do my best i promised by oath which i have kept for as the faith goeth at this day to heaven i do procure ten women to one man be sure then of lucifer my leave i took and straight unto the mastercook i was had into the kitchen for margerys office was therein all things handled there discreetly for every soul beareth office meetly which might be seen to see her sit so busily turning of the spit for many a spit here hath she turned and many a good spit hath she burned and many a spitful hot hath roastedbefore the meat could be half roasted and ere the meat were halfroasted indeed i took her then fro the spit with speed but when she saw this brought to pass to tell the joy wherein she was and of all the devils for joy how they did roar at her delivery and how the chains in hell did ring and how all the souls therein did sing and how we were brought to the gate and how we took our leave thereat be sure lack of time suffereth not to rehearse the twentieth part of that wherefore this tale to conclude briefly this woman thanked me chiefly that she was rid of this endless death and so we departed on newmarketheath and if that any man do mind her who lists to seek her there shall he find her pedlar sir ye have sought her wonders well and where ye found her as ye tell to hear the chance ye had in hell i find ye were in great peril palmer his tale is all much perilous but part is much more marvellous as where he said the devils complain that women put them to such pain be their conditions so crooked and crabbed frowardly fashioned so wayward and wrabbed so far in division and stirring such strife that all the devils be weary of their life this in effect he told for truth whereby much marvel to me ensueth that women in hell such shrews can be and here so gentle as far as i see yet have i seen many a mile and many a woman in the while not one good city town or borough in christendom but i have been thorough and this i would ye should understand i have seen women five hundred thousand and oft with them have long time tarried yet in all places where i have been of all the women that i have seen i never saw nor knew in my conscience any one woman out of patience pothecary by the mass there is a great lie pardoner i never heard a greater by our lady pedlar a greater nay know ye any so great palmer sir whether that i lose or get for my part judgment shall be prayed pardoner and i desire as he hath said pothecary proceed and ye shall be obeyed pedlar then shall not judgment be delayed of all these three if each mans talein pauls churchyard were set on sale in some mans hand that hath the sleight he should sure sell these tales by weight for as they weigh so be they worth but which weigheth best to that now forth sir all the tale that ye did tell i bear in mind and yours as well and as ye saw the matter meetly so lied ye both well and discreetly yet were your lies with the least trust me for if ye had said ye had made flee ten tampions out of ten womens tails ten times ten mile to ten castles or jails and filled ten rivers ten times so deep as ten of that which your castlestones did keep or if ye ten times had bodily fet ten souls out of purgatory and ten times so many out of hell yet by these ten bones i could right well ten times sooner all that believed than the tenth part of that he hath meved pothecary two knaves before one lacketh two knaves of five then one and then one and both knaves alive then two and then two and three at a cast thou knave and thou knave and thou knave at last nay knave if ye try me by number i will as knavishly you accumber your mind is all on your privy tithe for all in ten methinketh your wit lith now ten times i beseech him that high sits thy wifes ten commandments may search thy five wits then ten of my turds in ten of thy teeth and ten on thy nose which every man seeth and twenty times ten this wish i would that thou hadst been hanged at ten year old for thou goest about to make me a slave i will thou know that i am a gentle knave and here is another shall take my part pardoner nay first i beshrew your knaves heart ere i take part in your knavery i will speak fair by our lady sir i beseech your maship to be as good as ye can be unto me pedlar i would be glad to do you good and him also be he ever so wood but doubt you not i will now do the thing my conscience leadeth me to both your tales i take for impossible yet take i his farther incredible not only the thing itself alloweth it but also the boldness thereof avoweth it i know not where your tale to try nor yours but in hell or purgatory but his boldness hath faced a lie that may be tried even in this company as if ye list to take this order among the women in this border take three of the youngest and three of the oldest three of the hottest and three of the coldest three of the wisest and three of the shrewdestthree of the chastest and three of the lewdest three of the lowest and three of the highest three of the farthest and three of the nighest three of the fairest and three of the maddest three of the foulest and three of the saddest and when all these threes be had asunder of each three two justly by number shall be found shrews except this fall that ye hap to find them shrews all himself for truth all this doth know and oft hath tried some of this row and yet he sweareth by his conscience he never saw woman break patience wherefore considered with true intent his lie to be so evident and to appear so evidently that both you affirmed it a lie and that my conscience so deeply so deep hath sought this thing to try and tried it with mind indifferent thus i award by way of judgment of all the lies ye all have spent his lie to be most excellent palmer sir though ye were bound of equity to do as ye have done to me yet do i thank you of your pain and will requite some part again pardoner marry sir ye can no less do but thank him as much as it cometh to and so will i do for my part now a vengeance on thy knaves heart i never knew a pedlar a judge before nor never will trust pedling knave more what doest thou there thou whoreson noddy pothecary by the mass learn to make courtesy courtesy before and courtesy behind him and then on each side the devil blind him nay when ye have it perfitly ye shall have the devil and all of courtesy but it is not soon learned gentle brother one knave to make courtesy to another yet when i am angry that is the worst i shall call my master knave at the first palmer then would some master perhaps clout ye but as for me ye need not doubt ye for i had liever be without ye than have such business about ye pothecary so help me god so were ye better what should a beggar be a jetter it were no whit your honesty to have us twain jet after ye pardoner sir be your sure he telleth you true if we should wait this would ensue it would be said trust me at a word two knaves made courtesy to the third pedlar now by my troth to speak my mindsince they be so both to be assigned to let them lose i think it best and so shall ye live the better in rest palmer sir i am not on them so fond to compel them to keep their bond and since ye list not to wait on me i clearly of waiting do discharge ye pardoner marry sir i heartily thank you pothecary and likewise i to god i vow pedlar now be ye all even as ye began no man hath lost nor no man hath wan yet in the debate wherewith ye began by way of advice i will speak as i can i do perceive that pilgrimage is chief the thing ye have in usage whereto in effect for the love of christ ye have or should have been enticed and who so doth with such intent doth well declare his time wellspent and so do ye in your pretence if ye procure thus indulgence unto your neighbours charitably for love of them in god only all this may be right well applied to show you both well occupied for though ye walk not both one way yet walking thus this dare i say that both your walks come to one end and so for all that do pretend by aid of gods grace to ensue any manner kind of virtue as some great alms for to give some in wilful poverty to live some to make highways and such like works and some to maintain priests and clerks to sing and pray for soul departed these with all other virtues well marked although they be of sundry kinds yet be they not used with sundry minds but as god only doth all those move so every man only for his love with love and dread obediently worketh in these virtues uniformly thus every virtue if we list to scan is pleasant to god and thankful to man and who that by grace of the holy ghost to any one virtue is moved most that man by that grace that one apply and therein serve god most plentifully yet not that one so far wide to wrest so liking the same to mislike the rest for who so wresteth his work is in vain and even in that case i perceive you twain liking your virtue in such wise that each others virtue ye do despise who walketh this way for god would find him the farther they seek him the farther behind him one kind of virtue to despise another is like as the sister might hang the brotherpothecary for fear lest such perils to me might fall i thank god i use no virtue at all pedlar that is of all the very worst way for more hard it is as i have heard say to begin virtue where none is pretended than where it is begun th abuse to be mended how be it ye be not all to begin one sign of virtue ye are entered in as this i suppose ye did say true in that ye said ye use no virtue in the which words i dare well report you are well beloved of all this sort by your railing here openly at pardons and relics so lewdly pothecary in that i think my fault not great for all that he hath i know counterfeit pedlar for his and all other that ye know feigned you be not counselled nor constrained to any such thing in any such case to give any reverence in any such place but where ye doubt the truth not knowing believing the best good may be growing in judging the best no harm at the least in judging the worst no good at the best but best in these things it seemeth to me to make no judgment upon ye but as the church doth judge or take them so do ye receive or forsake them and so be you sure ye cannot err but may be a fruitful follower pothecary go ye before and as i am true man i will follow as fast as i can pardoner and so will i for he hath said so well reason would we should follow his counsel palmer then to our reason god give us his grace that we may follow with faith so firmly his commandments that we may purchase his love and so consequently to believe his church fast and faithfully so that we may according to his promise be kept out of error in any wise and all that hath scaped us here by negligence we clearly revoke and forsake it to pass the time in this without offence was the cause why the maker did make it and so we humbly beseech you to take it beseeching our lord to prosper you all in the faith of his church universala new interlude called thersites edition a new enterlude called thersytes this enterlude followynge dothe declare

chief dependence of society will ever be upon the drama still the history of the english stage remains very imperfect obscure and unsatisfactory perhaps of no period are fewer particulars known than that in which a struggle for precedence arose between the moral new interlude and the merry new interlude or when common sense being partially relieved from bigotry and cold superstition gave licence to the infant votaries of the drama to drive from thespian scaffolds old vice the prosing loquacious hero of mysteries and moralities somewhere near that period the two following pieces written for buskined boys were performed and being undoubtedly esteemed popular both printed but without dates an entry was made of the first as jack juggeler and mrs boundgrace in the stationers book by william copland in in thersites the author by the epilogue has noted the precise time of its being written in mentioning the birth of prince edward afterwards king edward vi which happened the th of august and invoking the almighty to save the queen lovely lady jane who is supposed to have died the second day after that event if then acted it was probably revived on the accession of queen elizabeth and printed by tysdale whose typographical labours did not commence in allhallows churchyard until so rare were both interludes that their existence had long been doubted when in they were discovered in a private collection of ancient plays that collection was so large and contained specimens of the early drama so little known as to induce a spirited bibliopolist to purchase the whole projecting a republication of old english mysteries moralities interludes pageants and plays it was to have extended to twenty octavo volumes unfortunately an announcement of a similar nature although upon a smaller scale and afterwards meagrely executed deterred the intended proprietors from the venture of the large capital necessary to complete so extensive an undertaking hence the whole collection was promiscuously dispersed and so widely as to prevent a reference to these interludes when needed to ascertain the character and size of the black letter type used that circumstance has occasioned a deviation from the strict rule of a facsimile followed in all other respects except adding for convenience a pagination by the use of modern type however another specimen is secured from the valuable private press of an absent member at the same time convinced such a deviation can seldom be tolerated there can only be pleaded the opportunity of extending some knowledge of two unique copies the now almost olden venial transgression of him who will probably continue sinning until the forced guest to banquet with the doctor and his associate may mr child observes the play does not require particular notice its lively absurdity could not have failed to be entertaining to an easy audience and is not tiresome now thersites indulges plentifully in one of the privileges of the old vicethat of talking incoherent nonsense there is a vigour in some parts quite unusual in these things and many of the lines in skeltons metre have some of his power together with all his coarseness the passage pp may remind the reader of that remarkable poem elynour rummyng thersites thersites cometh in first having a club upon his neck have in a ruffler forth of the greek land called thersites if ye will me know aback give me room in my way do ye not stand for if ye do i will soon lay you low in homer of my acts ye have read i trow neither agamemnon nor ulysses i spared to check they could not bring me to be at their beck of late from the siege of troy i returned where all my harness except this club i lostin an old house there it was quite burned while i was preparing victuals for the host i must needs get me new whatsoever it cost i will go seek adventures for i can not be idle i will hamper some of the knaves in a bridle it grieveth me to hear how the knaves do brag but by supreme jupiter when i am harnessed well i shall make the dasters to renne into a bag to hide them fro me as fro the devil of hell i doubt not but hereafter of me ye shall hear tell how i have made the knaves for to play couchquail but now to the shop of mulciber to go i will not fail mulciber must have a shop made in the place and thersites cometh before it saying aloud mulciber whom the poets doth call the god of fire smith unto jupiter king over all come forth of thy office i thee desire and grant me my petition i ask a thing but small i will none of thy lightning that thou art wont to make for the gods supernal for ire when they do shake with which they thrust the giants down to hell that were at a convention heaven to buy and sell but i would have some help of lemnos and ithalia that of their steel by thy craft condatur mihi galea mulciber what fellow thersites do ye speak latin now nay then farewell i make god a vow i do not you understand no latin is in my pallet and then he must do as he would go away thersites i say abide good mulciber i pray thee make me a sallet mulciber why thersites hast thou any wit in thy head wouldst thou have a sallet now all the herbs are dead beside that it is not meet for a smith to gather herbs and sallets to meddle with go get thee to my lover venus she hath sallets enough for all us i eat none such sallets for now i wax old and for my stomach they are very cold thersites now i pray to jupiter that thou die a cuckold i mean a sallet with which men do fight mulciber it is a small tasting of a mans might that he should for any matter fight with a few herbs in a platter no great laud should follow that victorythersites gods passion mulciber where is thy wit and memory i would have a sallet made of steel mulciber why sir in your stomach long you shall it feel for steel is hard for to digest thersites mans bones and sides he is worse than a beast i would have a sallet to wear on my head which under my chin with a thong red buckled shall be dost thou yet perceive me mulciber your mind now i see why thou peevish lad art thou almost mad or well in thy wit get thee a wallet would thou have a sallet what wouldst thou do with it thersites i pray thee good mulciber make no mo bones but let me have a sallet made at once mulciber i must do somewhat for this knave aside what manner of sallet sir would ye have thersites i would have such a one that nother might nor main should pierce it through or part it in twain which nother gunstone nor sharp spear should be able other to hurt or tear i would have it also for to save my head if jupiter himself would have me dead and if he in a fume would cast at me his fire this sallet i would have to keep me from his ire mulciber i perceive your mind ye shall find me kind i will for you prepare and then he goeth into his shop and maketh a sallet for him at the last he saithhere thersites do this sallet wear and on thy head it bear and none shall work thee care then mulciber goeth into his shop until he is called again thersites now would i not fear with any bull to fight or with a ramping lion nother by day nor night oh what great strength is in my body so lusty which for lack of exercise is now almost rusty hercules in comparison to me was but a boy when the bandog cerberus from hell he bare away when he killed the lion hydra and the boar so wild compare him to me and he was but a child why samson i say hast thou no more wit wouldst thou be as strong as i come suck thy mothers teat ween you that david that little elfish boy should with his sling have take my life away nay iwis goliath for all his five stones i would have quashed his little boyish bones oh how it would do my heart much good to see some of the giants before noes flood i would make the knaves to cry crik or else with my club their brains i will break but mulciber yet i have not with thee do my head is armed my neck i would have too and also my shoulders with some good habergin that the devil if he shot at me could not enter in for i am determined great battle to make except my fumishness by some means may aslake mulciber buckle on this habergin as fast as thou can and fear for the meeting of nother beast nor man if it were possible for one to shoot an oak this habergin will defend thee from the stroke let them throw milestones at thee as thick as hail yet thee to kill they shall of their purpose fail if malvern hills should on thy shoulders light they shall not hurt them nor suppress thy might if bevis of hampton colburn and guy will thee assay set not by them a fly to be brief this habergin shall thee save both by land and water now play the lusty knave then he goeth into his shop again thersites when i consider my shoulders that so broad be when the other parts of my body i do behold i verily think that none in christianty with me to meddle dare be so bold now have at the lions on cotsold i will neither spare for heat nor for cold where art thou king arthur and the knights

from the dogs in a chace would not thy black and rusty grim beard now thou art so armed make any man afeard surely if jupiter did see thee in this gear he would renne away and hide him for fear he would think that typhaeus the giant were alive and his brother enceladus again with him to strive if that mars of battle the god stout and bold in this array should chance thee to behold he would yield up his sword unto thee and god of battle he would say thou shouldst be now fare thou well go the world through and seek adventures thou art man good enou thersites mulciber while the stars shall shine in the sky and phaetons horses with the suns chariot shall fly while the morning shall go before noon and cause the darkness to vanish away soon while that the cat shall love well milk and while
