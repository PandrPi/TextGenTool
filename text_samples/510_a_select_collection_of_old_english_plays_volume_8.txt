and prodigality grim the collier of croydon summers last will and testament edition a pleasant comedie called summers last will and testament written by thomas nash imprinted at london by simon stafford for water burre tocolliers preface thomas nash son of william nash minister and margaret his wife was baptized at lowestoft in suffolk in november he was admitted a scholar at st johns college cambridge on the lady margarets foundation in and proceeded ba in the following is a copy of the register tho nashe coll joh cantab ab ib the place though not the time of his birth we have under his own authority for in his lenten stuff printed in he informs us that he was born at lowestoft and he leads us to conclude that his family was of some note by adding that his father sprang from the nashes of herefordshire it does not appear that nash ever proceeded master of arts at cambridge and most of his biographers agree that he left his college about it is evident however that he had got into disgrace and probably was expelled for the author of england to her three daughters in polimanteia speaking of harvey and nash and the pending quarrel between them uses these terms cambridge make thy two children friends thou hast been unkind to the one to wean him before his time and too fond upon the other to keep him so long without preferment the one is ancient and of much reading the other is young but full of wit the cause of his disgrace is reported to have been the share he took in a piece called terminus et non terminus not now extant and it is not denied that his partner in this offence was expelled most likely therefore nash suffered the same punishment if nash be the author of an almond for a parrot of which there is little doubt although his name is not affixed to it he travelled in italy and we find from another of his pieces that he had been in ireland perhaps he went abroad soon after he abandoned cambridge and before he settled in london and became an author his first appearance in this character seems to have been in and we believe the earliest date of any tract attributed to him relating to martin marprelate is also he was the first as has been frequently remarked to attack this enemy of the church with the keen missiles of wit and satire throwing aside the lumbering and unserviceable weapons of scholastic controversy having set the example in this respect he had many followers and imitators and among them john lily the dramatic poet the author of pap with a hatchet in london nash became acquainted with robert greene and their friendship drew him into a long literary contest with gabriel harvey to which nash owes much of his reputation it arose out of the posthumous attack of harvey upon robert greene of which sufficient mention has been made elsewhere nash replied on behalf of his dead companion and reiterated the charge which had given the original offence to harvey viz that his brother was the son of a ropemaker one piece was humorously dedicated to richard litchfield a barber of cambridge and harvey answered it under the assumed character of the same barber in a tract called the trimmino of thomas nash which also contained a woodcut of a man in fetters this representation referred to the imprisonment of nash for an offence he gave by writing a play not now extant called the isle of dogs and to this event francis meres alludes in his palladia tamia in these terms as actaeon was worried of his own hounds so is tom nash of his isle of dogs dogs were the death of euripides but be not disconsolate gallant young juvenal linus the son of apollo died the same death yet god forbid that so brave a wit should so basely perishthine are but paper dogs neither is thy banishment like ovids eternally to converse with the barbarous getes therefore comfort thyself sweet tom with ciceros glorious return to rome and with the council aeneas gives to his seabeaten soldiers lib i aeneid pluck up thine heart and drive from thence both fear and care away to think on this may pleasure be perhaps another day durato et temet rebus servato secundis fol this was in part verified in the next year for when nash published his lenten stuff he referred with apparent satisfaction to his past troubles in consequence of his isle of dogs so much has been said especially by mr disraeli in his quarrels of authors on the subject of this dispute between nash and harvey that it is unnecessary to add anything excepting that it was carried to such a length and the pamphlets contained so much scurrility that it was ordered from authority in that all the tracts on both sides should be seized and suppressed as with greene so with nash an opinion on his moral conduct and general deportment has been too readily formed from the assertions of his opponents and because gabriel harvey to answer a particular purpose states you may be in one prison today and in another tomorrow it has been taken for granted that after his arrival in london he was often confined in different jails no doubt he and his companions greene marlowe and peele led very disorderly lives and it is singular that all four died prematurely the oldest of them probably not being forty years of age it is certain that nash was not living at the time when the return from parnassus was produced which though not printed until waswritten before the end of the reign of elizabeth his ashes are there spoken of as at rest but the mention of him as dead nearest to the probable date of that event is to be found in fitzgeoffreys affaniae where an epitaph upon him is printed his name also occurs in an anonymous poem under the title of the ant and the nightingale or father hubbards tales where the following stanza is met with or if in bitterness thou rail like nash forgive me honest soul that term thy phrase railing for in thy works thou wert not rash nor didst affect in youth thy private praise thou hadst a strife with that tergemini thou hurtdst them not till they had injured thee the author of a ms epitaph in bibl sloan pl xxi a was not so squeamish in the language he employed here lies tom nash that notable railer that in his life neer paid shoemaker nor tailor the following from thomas freemans epigrams is not out of its place of thomas nash nash had lycambes on earth living been the time thou wast his death had been all one had he but movd thy tartest muse to spleen unto the fork he had as surely gone for why there lived not that man i think usd better or more bitter gall in ink it is impossible in the present day to attempt anything like a correct list of the productions of nash many of which were unquestionably printed without his name the titles of and quotations from a great number may be found in the various bibliographical miscellanies easily accessible when he began to write cannot be ascertained but it was most likely soon after his return from the continent and the dispute between john penry and the bishops seems then to have engaged his pen there is one considerable pamphlet by him called christs tears over jerusalem printed in which like some of the tracts by greene is of a repentant and religious character and it has been said that though published with his name it was not in fact his production there is no sufficient ground for this supposition and nash never subsequently disowned the performance the address to the reader contains an apology to gabriel harvey for the attack upon him in terms that seem to vouch for their own sincerity nothing says nash is there now so much in my vows as to be at peace with all men and make submissive amends where i most displeased not basely fearblasted or constraintively overruled but purely pacificatory suppliant for reconciliation and pardon do i sue to the principallest of them gainst whom i professed utter enmity even of master doctor harvey i heartily desire the like whose fame and reputation through some precedent injurious provocations and fervent excitements of young heads i rashly assailed yet now better advised and of his perfections more confirmedly persuaded unfeignedly i entreat of the whole world from my pen his worth may receive no impeachment all acknowledgments of abundant scholarship courteous wellgoverned behaviour and ripe experienced judgment do i attribute to him we have already seen with what malignity harvey trampled upon the corpse of greene and he received this apology of nash in a corresponding spirit for instead of accepting it in his new letter of notable contents he rejects it with scorn riotous vanity he replies was wont to root so deeply that it could hardly be unrooted and where reckless impudency taketh possession it useth not very hastily to be dispossessed what say you to a spring of rankest villainy in february and a harvest of ripest divinity in may but what should we hereafter talk any more of paradoxes or impossibilities when he that penned the most desperate and abominable pamphlet of strange news and disgorged his stomach of as poisonous rancour as ever was vomited in print within few months is won or charmed or enchanted or what metamorphosis should i term it to astonish carnal minds with spiritual meditations c such a reception of wellintended and eloquentlywritten amends was enough to make nash repent even his repentance as far as gabriel harvey was concerned of the popularity of nash as a writer some notion may be formed from a fact he himself mentions in his have with you to saffron walden that between when his pierce penniless his supplication to the devil was first printed and it passed through the pikes of at least six impressions how long his reputation as a satirist survived him may be judged from the fact that in taylor the water poet published a tract which had for its second title tom nash his ghost the old martin queller newly rouzd and in mercurius antipragmaticus from oct to oct is the following passage perhaps you will be angry now and when you steal forth disguised in your next intelligence thunder forth threatenings against me and be as satirical in your language as ever was your predecessor nash who compiled alearned treatise in the praise of a red herring only two plays in which nash had any concern have come down to us his isle of dogs before noticed was probably never printed or at all events it is not now known to exist he wrote alone a pleasant comedy called summers last will and testament to in conjunction with marlowe he produced the tragedy of dido queen of carthage played by the children of her majestys chapel to phillips in his theatrum poetarum also assigned to nash see me and see me not a comedy which may be a different play and not as has been generally supposed hans beer pot because

wherefore was gold laid under our feet in the veins of the earth but that we should contemn it and tread upon it and so consequently tread thrift under our feet it was not known till the iron age donec facinus invasit mortales as the poet says and the scythians always detested it i will prove it that an unthrift of any comes nearest a happy man in so much as he comes nearest to beggary cicero saith summum bonum consists in omnium rerum vacatione that is the chiefest felicity that may be to rest from all labours now who doth so much vacare à rebus who rests so much who hath so little to do as the beggar who can sing so merry a note as he that cannot change a groat cui nil est nil deest he that hath nothing wants nothing on the other side it is said of the carl omnia habeo nec quicquam

upbraid them because they cannot live if they be poor it is a common proverb divesque miserque a rich man and a miserable nam natura paucis contenta none so contented as the poor man admit that the chiefest happiness were not rest or ease but knowledge as herillus alcidamus and many of socrates followers affirm why paupertas omnes perdocet artes poverty instructs a man in all arts it makes a man hardy and venturous and therefore is it called of the poets paupertas audax valiant poverty it is not so much subject to inordinate desires as wealth or prosperity non habet unde suum paupertas pascat amorem poverty hath not wherewithal to feed lust all the poets were beggars all alchemists and all philosophers are beggars omnia mea mecum porto quoth bias when he had nothing but bread and cheese in a leathern bag and two or three books in his bosom saint francis a holy saint and never had any money it is madness to doat upon muck that young man of athens aelianus makes mention of may be an example to us who doated so extremely on the image of fortune that when he might not enjoy it he died for sorrow the earth yields all her fruits together and why should we not spend them together i thank heavens on my knees that have made me an unthrift sum o vanity itself o wit illspent so study thousands not to mend their lives but to maintain the sin they most affect to be hells advocates

merry and we hear a filthy beggarly oration in the praise of beggary it is a beggarly poet that writ it and that makes him so much commend it because he knows not how to mend himself well rather than he shall have no employment but lick dishes i will set him a work myself to write in praise of the art of stooping and how there never was any famous thresher porter brewer pioneer or carpenter that

willed him to go to aristagoras into the country and bid him shave him as he had done and he should have perfect remedy he did so aristagoras shaved him with his own hands read his friends letter and

they lick and purify it with their tongue and well observe hippocrates old rule the only medicine for the foot is rest for if they have the least hurt in their feet they bear them up and look they be

ulli the downfall of robert earl of huntington edition the downfall of robert earle of huntington afterward called robin hood of merrie sherwodde with his love to chaste matilda the lord fitzwaters daughter afterwarde his faire maide marian acted by the right honourable the earle of notingham lord high admirall of england his servants imprinted at london for william leake to blintroduction the downfall of robert earl of huntington and the death of robert earl of huntington were both formerly ascribed to thomas heywood on the always disputable authority of kirkman the bookseller the discovery of the folio accountbook of philip henslowe proprietor of the rose theatre on the bankside enabled malone to correct the error the following entries in henslowes mss contain the evidence upon the subject feb the first part of robin hood by anthony mundy the second part of the downfall of earl huntington sirnamed robinhood by anthony mundy and henry chettle it is to be observed that what henslowe mentions as the second part of the downfall of earl huntington is in fact the play called on the printed titlepage the death of robert earl of huntington hence we find that anthony munday wrote the first part or downfall alone and the second part or death in conjunction with henry chettle nevertheless there is a memorandum by henslowe by which it seems that chettle had something to do also with the first part it is in these terms lent unto robarte shawe the of novemb to lend unto mr cheattle upon the mending of the first part of robart hoode the sum of xs the loan here mentioned was perhaps in anticipation of the mending and malone subsequently met with the following notice for mending of robin hood for the corte which might be written after the improvements considered necessary before the performance of the play at court had been completed anthony munday must have been born in for the monument to him in the church of st stephen coleman street states that at the time of his death th august he was eighty years old from the inscription we likewise learn that he was a citizen and draper in he lived in the city and dates his translation of the history of palmendos from my house in cripplegate that he carried on the business of a draper or had some connection with the trade as late as may be gathered from the following passage at the close of the triumphs of truth the city pageant for that year by thomas middleton the firework being made by maister humphrey nichols a man excellent in his art and the whole work and body of the triumph with all the proper beauties of the workmanship most artfully and faithfully performed by john grinkin and those furnished with apparel and porters by anthony munday gentleman the style of gentleman was probably given to him with reference to the productions of his pen at what date he acquired the title of poet to the city does not appear he wrote the lord mayors pageant in but he had certainly earlier been similarly employed as ben jonson introduces him in that capacity in the case is altered which was written in the end of or beginning of he there throws some ridicule upon don antonio balladino as he calls munday and mr gifford was of opinion that middleton meant to censure him in his triumphs of truth as the impudent common writer of city pageants but this is hardly consistent with the mention middleton introduces of munday at the close of that performance besides dekker wrote the pageant for the year immediately preceding that for which middleton was engaged and that munday was not in disrepute is obvious from the fact that in and his pen was again in request for the same purpose whatever might have been mundays previous life in the year he was placed in no very enviable situation he had been mainly instrumental in detecting the popish conspiracy in that year which drew down upon him the bitter animosity of the jesuits they charged him in their publications from which extracts may be seen in mr a chalmers biographical dictionary and elsewhere with having been first a stageplayer and afterwards an apprentice and after being hissed from the stage and residing at rome with having returned to his original occupation munday himself admits in the account he published of edmund campion and his confederates that he was some time the popes scholar in the seminary of rome but always stoutly denied that he was a roman catholic perhaps the most curious tract upon this subject is that entitled a breefe and true reporte of the execution of certaine traytours at tiborne the xxviii and xxx dayes of may gathered by am who was there present he signs the dedication at length a munday and mentions that he had been a witness against some of the offenders the persons he saw executed were thomas foord john shert robert johnson william filbie luke kirbie lawrance richardson and thomas cottom and he seems to have been publicly employed to confute them at the foot of the gallows and to convince the populace that they were traitors and papists denying the supremacy of queen elizabeth he there had a long dispute with kirbie upon matters of fact and according to his own showing was guilty while abroad at least of a little duplicity he notices having seen captain stukely at rome who was killed at the battle of alcazar in in the conclusion he promises his english romaine lyfe so soon as it can be printed in which he purposes to disclose the romish and sathanical juglings of the jesuitsmunday was a very voluminous author in verse and prose original and translated and is certainly to be reckoned among the predecessors of shakespeare in dramatic composition his earliest work as far as can be now ascertained was the mirror of mutability when he was in his th year he dedicates it to the earl of oxford and perhaps then belonged to the company of players of that nobleman to which he had again attached himself on his return from italy the council registers show that this nobleman had a company of players under his protection in mundays banquet of dainty conceits was printed in and we particularise it because it was unknown to ames herbert and ritson catalogues and specimens of his other undramatic works may be found in bibliographia poetica censura literaria british bibliographer c the earliest praise of munday is contained in webbes discourse of english poetrie where his sweete sobs of sheepheardes and nymphes is especially pointed out as very rare poetrie francis meres in palladis tamia fo b enumerating many of the best dramatic poets of his day including shakespeare heywood chapman porter lodge c gives anthony munday the praise of being our best plotter a distinction that excited the spleen of ben jonson in his case is altered more particularly as he was omitted nearly all the existing information respecting anthony mundays dramatic works is derived from henslowes papers at what period he began to write for the stage cannot be ascertained the earliest date in these mss connected with his name is december but as he was perhaps a member of the earl of oxfords theatrical company before he went abroad and as he was certainly at rome prior to it is likely that he was very early the author of theatrical performances in the old catalogues and in langbaines momus triumphans a piece called fidele and fortunatus is mentioned and such a play was entered at stationers hall nov there is little doubt that this is the same production two copies of which have been discovered with the running title of two italian gentlemen that being the second title to fidele and fortunatus in the register both copies are without titlepages but to one of them is prefixed a dedication signed am and we may with tolerable certainty conclude that anthony munday was the author or translator of it and that it was printed about the date of its entry on the stationers books it is pretty evident that the play now reprinted from the only known edition in was written considerably before the year when it is first noticed in the accounts of the proprietor of the rose the story is treated with a simplicity bordering upon rudeness and historical facts are perverted just as suited the purpose of the writer whether we consider it as contemporary with or preceding the productions of the same class by shakespeare it is a relic of high interest and nearly all the sylvan portions of the play in which robin hood and his merry men are engaged are of no ordinary beauty some of the serious scenes are also extremely well written and the blankverse interpersed with rhymes as was usual in our earlier dramas by no means inharmonious the subsequent catalogue of plays which munday wrote either alone or in conjunction with others is derived from the materials supplied by malone mother redcap by anthony munday and michael drayton december not printed the downfall of robert earl of huntington by

open friend and yet are doubtful whether he deserve a public trial for his private wrongs ches i still am doubtful whether it be fit to punish private faults with public shame in such a person as lord ely is prior yes honourable chester more it fits to make apparent sins of mighty men and on their persons sharply to correct a little fault a very small defect than on the poor to practise chastisement for if a poor man die or suffer shame only the poor and vile respect the same but if the mighty fall fear then besets the proud heart of the mighty ones his mates they think the world is garnished with nets and traps ordained to entrap their states which fear in them begets a fear of ill and makes them good contrary to their will john your lordship hath said right lord salisbury is

ambition in yourself his state envied where is fitzwater that old honourd lord john dishonourd and exild as ely is lei exild he may be but dishonourd never he was a fearless soldier and a virtuous scholar but where is huntington that noble youth ches undone by riot lei ah the greater ruth john leicester you question more than doth become you on to the purpose why you come to uslei i come to ely and to all the state sent by the king who three times sent before to have his ransom brought to austria and if you be elected deputy do as you ought and send the ransommoney john leicester you see i am no deputy and richards ransom if you do require thus we make answer richard is a king in cyprus acon acre and rich palestine to get those kingdoms england lent him men and many a million of her substance spent the very entrails of her womb were rent no plough but paid a share no needy hand but from his poor estate of penury unto his voyage offerd more than mites and more poor souls than they had might to spare yet were they joyful for still flying news and lying i perceive them now to be came of king richards glorious victories his conquest of the soldan and such tales as blew them up with hope when he returnd he would have scatterd gold about the streets lei do princes fight for gold o leaden thought your father knew that honour was the aim kings level at by sweet st john i swear you urge me so that i cannot forbear what do you tell of money lent the king when first he went into this holy war as if he had extorted from the poor when you the queen and all that hear me speak know with what zeal the people gave their goods old wives took silver buckles from their belts young maids the gilt pins that tuckd up their trains children their pretty whistles from their necks and every man what he did most esteem crying to soldiers wear these gifts of ours this proves that richard had no need to wrong or force the people that with willing hearts gave more than was desird and where you say you do guess richards victories but lies i swear he wan rich cyprus with his sword and thence more glorious than the guide of greece that brought so huge a fleet to tenedos he saild along the mediterran sea where on a sunbright morning he did meet the warlike soldans wellprepared fleet o still methinks i see king richard stand in his gilt armour staind with pagans blood upon a galleys prow like wars fierce god and on his crest a crucifix of gold o that days honour can be never told six times six several brigantines he boarded and in the greedy waves flung wounded turks and three times thrice the winged galleys banks wherein the soldans son was admiral in his own person royal richard smoothd and left no heathen hand to be upheavd against the christian soldiers john leicester sodid he all this lei ay by god he did and more than this nay jest not at it john i swear he did by leicesters faith he did and made the green sea red with pagan blood leading to joppa glorious victory and following fear that fled unto the foe john all this he did perchance all this was so lei holy god help me soldiers come away this carpetknight sits carping at our scars and jests at those most glorious wellfought wars john leicester you are too hot stay go not yet methinks if richard won those victories the wealthy kingdoms he hath conquered may better than poor england pay his ransom he left this realm as a young orphanmaid to ely the stepfather of this state that strippd the virgin to her very skin and leicester had not john more careful been than richard at this hour england had not england been therefore good warlike lord take this in brief we wish king richard well but can send no relief lei o let not my heart break with inward grief john yes let it leicester it is not amiss that twenty such hearts break as your heart is lei are you a mother were you englands queen were henry richard geoffery your sons all sons but richardsun of all those sons and can you let

colours to my hands for i am full of grief and full of rage john look upon me thus did richard take the coward austrias colours in his handand thus he cast them under acon walls and thus he trod them underneath his feet rich colours how i wrong ye by this wrong but i will right ye bearer take them again and keep them ever ever them maintain we shall have use for them i hope ere long john darst

know them all from marians eye shall not one tear be shed skelton i faith tis not the fashion the king must grieve the queen must take it ill ely must mourn aged fitzwater weep prince john the lords

pursuit became a nunat dunmow abbey where she constantly chose death to save her spotless chastity take but my word and if i fail in this then let my pains be baffled with a hiss finis edition the death of robert earle of huntington otherwise called robin hood of merrie sherwodde with the lamentable tragedie of chaste matilda his faire maid marian poysoned at dunmowe by king iohn acted by the right honourable the earle of notingham lord high admirall of england his seruants imprinted at london for william leake to blintroduction henry chettle who certainly joined anthony munday in writing the death of robert earl of huntington if he did not also assist in penning the downfall of robert earl of huntington was a very prolific dramatic author malone erroneously states that he was the writer of or was concerned in thirty plays according to information which he himself furnishes fortytwo are either wholly or in part to be assigned to chettle the titles of only twentyfive are inserted in the biographia dramatica the proof of his connection with the historical play now reprinted has been already supplied and it is derived from the same source as nearly all the rest of the intelligence regarding his worksthe mss of henslowe of the incidents of the life of henry chettle absolutely nothing is known we are ignorant of the times and places of his birth and death and of the manner in which he obtained his education it has been conjectured that he either was or had been a printer but the point is very doubtful in a tract by him called englands mourning garment on the death of queen elizabeth he speaks of himself as having been young almost thirty years ago and as having been a witness of what passed at that period in the court if ritsons conjecture had been wellfounded he might have been admitted as an author as early as but the poetical tract assigned to him under that date was the work of some other writer with the same initials whose name is not known the first account we have of chettle in connection with the stage is under date of april when according to henslowe he was engaged with dekker in writing a play called troilus and cressida but there is good reason to infer that if in he were young almost thirty years ago he had written for the theatre before besides in his kind hartes dreame produced about three months after the death of his friend robert greene on september d he speaks generally of his connection with the dramatic poets of that day as if it were not newly formed malone supposed that shakespeare with whom chettle had then recently become acquainted was alluded to in the same tract in englands mourning garment chettle addresses a stanza to silvertongued melicert whom some critics have supposed to be shakespeare but this is mere conjecture francis meres in his oftenquoted palladis tamia includes chettle in a long list of other writers for the stage as one of the best for comedy but in earlier works upon the poetry and literature of england such as webbes discourse in and puttenhams art of english poesie in he is not mentioned henslowes list of plays with the authors names attached as edited by mr collier begins in february and there the first mention of chettle is in february between that date and march a period of little more than five years he wrote or assisted in writing all the dramatic performances with which his name is associated a fact of itself sufficient to show if henslowe be accurate that in many of them his share must have been very inconsiderable perhaps only amounting to a few alterations

advanced to chettle jonson dekker and other gentlemen on account of a tragedy they were engaged upon called robert the second king of scots the interest of the second part of robert earl of huntington on the whole is stronger than that of the first part and some powerful though not always tasteful writing gives effect to the situations the death of robin hood takes place as early as the end of the first act and attention is afterwards directed to the two otherwise unconnected plots of the fateof lady bruce and her little son and of the love of king john for matilda robert davenports tragedy of king john and matilda printed in goes precisely over the same ground and with many decided marks of imitation especially in the conduct of the story davenports production is inferior in most respects

the child is with her own pure blood staind and defild my little brothers lips and chin alone are tainted with the blood but his even teeth like orient pearl or snowwhite ivory have not one touch of blood one little spot which is an argument the boy would not once stir his lips to taste that bloody food our cruelgentle mother ministerd but as it seemd for see his pretty palm is bloody too he cast it on the ground for on this side the blessed relics lie by famines rage divided from this shrine sad woful mother in jerusalem who when thy son and thou didst faint for food buried his sweet flesh in

only one known and from that source it is now for the first time reprinted mr collier hist engl dram poetr ii points out that there is internal evidence from the allusion to the d year of queen elizabeth that the production was performed before her majesty in and it seems likely that it was a revival of a more ancient piece the writer just quoted remarks that a play called prodigality was exhibited at court in ibid note philips author of the theatrum poetarum in assigning it to greene followed either some tradition of the time or his own whim but he is not a trustworthy authority and his article on greene is assuredly as puerile and absurd a performance as could be imagined in the prologue the writer refers to childish years presumably his own and perhaps the contention was a youthful effort moreover from the not very appropriate introduction of latin terms here and there it is allowable to suspect that the author was preparing to graduate in arts if he had not done so the prologue the proverb is how many men so many minds which maketh proof how hard a thing it is of sundry minds to please the sundry kinds in which respect i have inferred this that where mens minds appear so different no play no part can all alike content the grave divine calls for divinity the civil student for philosophy the courtier craves some rare sound history the baser sort for knacks of

scene iii enter virtue and equity with other attendants vir my lords you see how far this worldly state perverted is from good declind inclined still to follow things amiss you see but very few that make of virtue any price you see all sorts with hungry wills run headlong into vice eq we see it oft we sorrow much and heartily lament that of himself man should not have a better government ver the very beasts that be devoid of reason dull and dumb by nature learn to shun those things whereof their hurt may come if man were then but as a beast only by nature taught he would also by nature learn to shun what things are nought but man with reason is endued he reason hath for stay which reason should restrain his will from going much astray eq madam tis true where reason rules there is the golden mean ver but most men stoop to stubborn will which conquereth reason cleaneq and will again to fancy yields which twain be special guides that train a man to tread ill paths where ease and pleasure bides ver no ease no pleasure can be good that is not got with pains eq that is the cause from virtues love mans fancy still refrains ver and pains i think they feel likewise that unto vice do bend eq they feel no doubt but yet such pains come not before the end vir i grieve for man that man should be of ill attempts so fain eq grieve not for that evil tasted once turns him to good again vir then will i take a cheerful mind unpleasant thoughts expel and cares for man commit to them that in the heavens do dwell eq do so dear madam i beseech you most heartily and recreate yourself before you go hence with some sweet melody the song if pleasure be the only thing that man doth seek so much chief pleasures rest where virtue rules no pleasures can be such though virtues ways be very strait her rocks be hard to climb yet such as do aspire thereto enjoy all joys in time plain is the passage unto vice the gaps lie wide to ill to them that wade through lewdness lake the ice is broken still this therefore is the difference the passage first seems hard to virtues train but then most sweet at length is their reward to those again that follow vice the way is fair and plain but fading pleasures in the end are bought with lasting pain if pleasure be the only thing c scene iv enter virtue equity liberality money and the sheriffvir now my lords i see no cause but that depart we

man joind woe unto my name by choosing out a woman for my wife a wife a curse ordained for the world fair helena fair she was indeed but foully staind with inward wickedness i kept her bravely and i lovd her dear but that dear love did cost my life and all to reckon up a thousand of her pranks her pride her wasteful spending her unkindness her false dissembling seeming sanctity her scolding pouting prating meddling and twenty hundred more of the same stamp were but to heap an endless catalogue of what the world is plagud with every day but for the main of that i have to tell it chanced thuslate in a rainy night a crew of gallants came unto my house and will i nill i would forsooth be lodgd i brought them in and made them all good cheer such as i had in store and lodgd them soft amongst them one ycleped paridell the falsest thief that ever trod on ground robbd me and with him stole away my wife i for i lovd her dear pursud the thief and after many days in travel spent found her amongst a crew of satyrs wild kissing and colling all the livelong night i spake her fair and prayd her to return but she in scorn commands me to be gone and glad i was to fly to save my life but when i backward came unto my house i find it spoild and all my treasure gone desprate and mad i ran i knew not whither calling and crying out on heaven and fate till seeing none to pity my distress i

patient mild and pitiful humours but ill agreeing with our kingdom enter belphegor and here he comes belphegor so it is we in our awful synod have decreed upon occasion to ourselves best known that thou from hence shall go into the world and take upon thee the shape of a man in which estate thou shalt be married choose thee a wife that best may please thyself and live with her a twelvemonth and a day thou shalt be subject unto human chance so far as common wit cannot relieve thee thou shalt of us receive ten thousand pounds sufficient stock to use for thy increase but whatsoever happens in

friar tuck by little tracy as he is called who supported the character of maid marian and others whose names are not mentioned the whole is only supposed to be a rehearsal prior to the representation of the piece before the king and in the course of it skelton and sir john eltham have various critical and explanatory interlocutions skelton it will be observed also undertakes the duty of interpreting the otherwise inexplicable dumbshow the old copy is not divided into acts and scenes old copy your in the old copy this direction is unnecessarily repeated in detail the direction inserted on p is repeated in full in the to this is in some sort a parody upon the wellknown proverb which is thus given by ray many talk of robin hood that never shot in his bow and many talk of little john that never did him know it is also found in camdens remains by philpot p though the two lines obviously connected in sense are there separated see also hazlitts proverbs p this sort of verse from the frequent use of it made by skelton in his poems acquired the name of skeltonic or skeltonical according to the manner in which the poets character is drawn he could not avoid falling into the use of it even out of its place in the course of the play and of this a singular instance is given after the capture and discovery of ely when sir john eltham in one of the interlocutions complains of skelton that in performing the part of friar tuck he fell into the vein of ribblerabble rhimes skeltonical in was published a tract with the following curious title a skeltonical salutation or condigne gratulation and just vexation of the spanish nation that in bravado spent many a crusado in setting forth an armado england to invado the whole piece is in this kind of verse a copy of it is in the british museum puttenham speaking of poetry of this sort says such were the rimes of skelton usurping the name of poet laureat being in deede but a rude rayling rimer and all his

entering at this juncture but they were on the stage before the mistake to which warman alludes is that friar tuck takes part with robin hood instead of assisting the sheriff against him this incident with some variations is related in the old ballad of robin hood rescuing the widows three sons from the sheriff when going to be executed see ritsons robin hood ii the old copy has a blank here but whether it was so in the original ms whether a line has dropped out by accident or whether it was meant that much should be suddenly interrupted by robin hood must be matter of conjecture so printed

the shoemaker of bradford who made all comers vail their staves and georgeagreene the pinner of wakefield yet such is the case in the text the exploits of both are celebrated in the play of the pinner of wakefield in dyces editions of greenes works which seems to have been popular nevertheless henslowe in his mss speaks of georgeagreene as one dramatic piece and of the pinner of wakefield as another as if they were two distinct heroes see malones shakespeare by boswell iii munday also makes scathlock and scarlet two separate persons munday does not confound the pinder of wakefield with the bradford hero for he expressly distinguishes between them but he errs in giving the latter the name of georgeagreene to record as applied to birds is synonymous to the verb to sing thus in the

from the introduction to this play that munday and others according to henslowe wrote a separate play under the title of the funeral of richard cordelion the latter drama was not written till some months after this and the ensuing piece and was intended as a sort of sequel to the plays on the history of robin hood misprinted dumwod in the old copy two lines in the epilogue might be quoted to show that only one author was concerned in it thus is matildas story shown in act and roughhewn out by an uncunning hand but probably the assertion is not to be taken strictly or if it be it will not prove that chettle had no hand earlier or later in the authorship mr gifford in his introduction to fords works vol i xvi remarks very truly that we are not to suppose from the combination of names of authors that they were always simultaneously employed in the production of the same play and munday who was perhaps an elder poet than chettle may have himself originally written both parts of the earl of huntington the connection of chettle with them being subsequent in making alterations or adapting them to the prevailing taste see the downfall of robert earl of huntington introd pp ante see

of the wit of a woman possibly a revival with alterations of edwardes play there is no list of characters prefixed to the old to ie skelton who is supposed by the author to have acted the part of friar tuck and who when first he comes on the stage is without his gown and hood old copy hurt the two are inside plotting together see infrâ the queen mother wight means active or sometimes clever it may be matter of conjecture whether white boy white poet white villain c so often found in old dramatists have not this origin it is very obvious that much begins his answer at cry ye mercy master king but his name is omitted in the old to the old copy adds here exeunt and a new scene is marked but this is a mistake as robin hood just afterwards converses with the prior sir doncaster and warman without any new entrance on their part they retire to the back of the stage warman is not mentioned but we find him on the stage just afterwards and he probably enters with robin hood the entrance of friar tuck is also omitted ie winding his horn the to reads pity of mind thine c see the last scene of the first part of this play the to merely reads exit and yet more medicinal is it than that moly

the odyssey relating to it the gods it moly call whose root to dig away is dangerous unto man but gods they all things may displeased old copy whindling see halliwell v whimlen there is also windilling but the word is one of those terms of contempt used by early writers rather loosely these two lines are taken with a slight change from the ballad of the jolly finder of wakefield see

old word strawd but when the author speaks afterwards in the stage direction he describes marian as strewing flowers shakespeare has oerstrawed in venus and adonis perhaps for the sake of the rhyme ie

highway that joineth to the power robin hood advises his uncle to insist upon his plea of privilegium clericale or benefit of clergystand to your clergy uncle save your life originally the law was held that no man should be admitted to the privilege of clergy but such as had the habitum et tonsuram clericalem but in process of time a much wider and more comprehensive criterion was established

initiated in holy orders nor trimmed with the clerical tonsureblackstones com iv b iv ch we have already seen that the king and nobles in this play called in the aid of friar tuck to read the inscription on the stags collar though the king could ascertain that it was in saxon characters this account of the death of robin hood varies from all the popular narratives and ballads the ms sloan nu f agrees with the ballad in ritson ii that he was treacherously bled to death by the prioress of kirksley the first act has already occupied too much space but it was difficult to divide it in fact as friar tuck says it is a short play complete in itself what follows is an induction to the rest of the story the friar continuing on the stage after the others have gone out the to reads thus apollos master doone i invocate but probably we ought to read apollos masterdom i invocate and the text has been altered accordingly masterdom means power rule to invocate apollos masterdom is therefore to invocate apollos power to assist the friar in his undertaking enter in black is the whole of the stage direction and those who enter are afterwards designated by the letters cho perhaps the principal performers arrive attired in black and are mentioned as chorus one speaking for the rest cho may however be a misprint for chester who was sent in to attire him in the new edit of nares

battlements as may suit the theatre with regard to the names hugh and winchester they are both wrong they ought to be hubert and chester who have been left by the king to keep good watch when too afterwards chester asks what richmond will you prove a runaway the answer in the old copy is from thee good winchester now the lord defend it ought to be from thee good chester now the lord defend and it is clear that the measure requires it the names throughout are very incorrectly given and probably the printer composed from a copy in which some alterations had been made in the dramatis personae

previous entrance of the queen and matilda is not marked fairness in which sense the word has already occurred in this piece ie champion matildas name is omitted in the old copy but the errors of this kind are too numerous to be always pointed out old copy triumvirates nothing can more clearly show the desperate confusion of names in this play than this line which in the to stands its lord hugh burgh alone hughberr what newes in many places hubert is only called hugh company or collection head of hungry wolves is the reading of the original copy a herd of hungry wolves would scarcely be proper but it may have been so written head may be right and we have not altered it as the word is occasionally used to signify a gathering or force in the old copy the four following lines are given

damon and pithias which was printed in and acted several years earlier the grim of the present play is obviously the same person as the grim of damon and pithias and in both he is said to be collier for the kings own majestys mouth chetwood may therefore be right when he states that it was printed in but perhaps that was not the first edition and the play was probably acted before damon and

sufficient to show that it was written before another instance to prove how much the arrangement of the plays made by mr reed was calculated to mislead some slight separate proofs of the age of this piece are pointed out in the new notes but the general evidence is much more convincing the versification is interlarded with rhymes like nearly all our earlier plays and the blank verse is such as was written before marlowes improvements had generally been adopted when the play was reprinted in some parts of it were perhaps a little modernised the introduction of malbecco and paridell into it
