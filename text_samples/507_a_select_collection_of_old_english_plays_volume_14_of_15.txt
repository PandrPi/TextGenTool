majesties company of revells written by thomas rawlins london printed by i okes for daniell frere and are to be sold at the signe of the red bull in little brittaine o introduction thomas rawlins author of the rebellion was a medallist by profession and afterwards became an engraver of the mint a vocation which in his preface he prefers to the threadbare occupation of a poet he also employed his talents occasionally in engraving frontispieces and portraits for books of which several signed specimens are known it is said that he died in it is an argument as well of his personal respectability as of his easy circumstances that no fewer than eleven copies of prefatory verses by the wits of the time are prefixed to the old edition notwithstanding the popularity of the piece which as it appears from the introductory poems was composed by rawlins in early life and several passages of real merit it was only once republished perhaps because rebellion soon assumed the whole kingdom for its stage besides his play rawlins published in an octavo volume of poems written also in his youth under the title of calanthe to the worshipful and his honoured kinsman robert ducie of aston in the county of stafford esquire son to sir r ducie knight and baronet deceased sirnot to boast of any perfections i have never yet been owner of ingratitude and would be loth envy should tax me now having at this time opportunity to pay part of that debt i owe your love this tragedy had at the presentment a general applause yet i have not that want of modesty as to conclude it wholly worthy your patronage although i have been bold to fix your name unto it yet however your charity will be famous in protecting this plant from the breath of zoilus and forgiving this my confidence and your acceptance cherish a study of a more deserving piece to quit the remainder of the engagement in your kinsman ready to serve you thomas rawlins to the readerreader if courteous i have not so little faith as to fear thy censure since thou knowest youth hath many faults whereon i depend although my ignorance of the stage is also a sufficient excuse if i have committed any let thy candour judge mildly of them and think not those voluntary favours of my friends by whose compulsive persuasions i have published this are commendations of my seeking or through a desire in me to increase the volume but rather a care that you since that i have been overentreated to present it to you might find therein something worth your time take no notice of my name for a second work of this nature shall hardly bear it i have no desire to be known by a threadbare cloak having a calling that will maintain it woolly farewell to his loving friend the author upon his tragedy the rebellion to praise thee friend and show the reason why issues from honest love not flattery my will is not to flatter nor for spite to praise or dispraise but to do thee right proud daring rebels in their impious way of machiavellian darkness this thy play exactly shows speaks thee truths satirist rebellions foe times honest artist thy continud scenes parts plots and language can distinguish worthily the virtuous man from the vicious villain earths fatal ill intending mischievous traitor machiavel him and his treachrous complices that strove like the gigantic rebels war gainst jove to disenthrone spains king the heavens anointed by stern death all were justly disappointed plots meet with counterplots revenge and blood rebels ruin makes thy tragedy good nath richards to his worthy esteemed master thomas rawlins on his rebellion i may not wonder for the world does know what poets can and ofttimes reach unto they oft work miracles no marvel then thou makst thy tailor here a nobleman would all the trade were honest too but he hath learnd the utmost of the mystery filching with cunning industry the heart of such a beauty which did prove the smart of many worthy lovers and doth gain that prize which others labourd for in vain thou makst him valiant too and such a spirit as every noble mind approves his merit but what renown th hast given his worth tis fit the world should render to thy hopeful wit and with a welcome plaudit entertain this lovely issue of thy teeming brain that their kind usage to this birth of thine may win so much upon thee for each line thou hast bequeathd the world thoult give her ten and raise more high the glory of thy pen accomplish these our wishes and then see how all that love the arts will honour thee c g to my friend master rawlins upon this play his workfriend in the fair completeness of your play y have courted truth in these few lines to say something concerning it that all may know i pay no more of praise than what i owe tis good and merit much more fair appears appareled in plain praise than when it wears a complimental gloss tailors may boast th have gaind by your young pen what they long lost by the old proverb which says three to a man but to your vindicating muse that can make one a man and a man noble they must wreaths of bays as their due praises pay robert davenport to the author on his rebellion thy play i neer saw what shall i say then i in my vote must do as other men and praise those things to all which common fame does boast of such a hopeful growing flame which in despite of flattery shall shine till envy at thy glory do repine and on parnassus cliffy top shall stand directing wandring wits to wishdfor land like a beacon o th muses hill remain that still doth burn no lesser light retain to show that other wits compard with thee is but rebellion i th highst degree for from thy labours thus much i do scan a tailor is ennobled to a man r w to his dear friend mr thomas rawlins to see a springot of thy tender age with such a lofty strain to word a stage to see a tragedy from thee in print with such a world of fine meanders int puzzles my wondring soul for there appears such disproportion twixt thy lines and years that when i read thy lines methinks i see the sweettongued ovid fall upon his knee with parce precor every line and word runs in sweet numbers of its own accord but i am wonderstruck that all this while thy unfeatherd quill should write a tragic style this above all my admiration draws that one so young should know dramatic laws tis rare and therefore is not for the span or greasy thumbs of every common man the damask rose that sprouts before the spring is fit for none to smell at but a king go on sweet friend i hope in time to see thy temples rounded with the daphnean tree and if men ask who nursd thee ill say thus it was the ambrosian spring of pegasus robert chamberlainto his friend master thomas rawlins on his play called the rebellion i will not praise thee friend nor is it fit lest i be said to flatter what y have writ for some will say i writ to applaud thee that when i print thou mayst do so for me faith theyre deceivd thou justly claimst thy bays virtue rewards herself thy works thy praise t jourdan to the author master thomas rawlins kind friend excuse me that do thus intrude thronging thy volume with my lines so rude applause is needless here yet this i owe as due to th muses thine neer sud i know for hands nor voice nor pen nor other praise whatsoeer by mortals usd thereby to raise an authors name eternally to bliss weret rightly scannd alas what folly tis as if a poets single work alone wants power to lift him to the spangled throne of highest jove or needs their lukewarm fires to cut his way or pierce the circled spheres foolish presumption whosoeer thou art thus fondly deemst of poets princely art here needs no paltry petty pioneers skill to fortify nay thy mellifluous quill strikes momus with amaze and silence deep and doomd poor zoilus to the lethean sleep then bent dismayd i know thy book will live and deathless trophies to thy name shall give who doubts where venus and minerva meet in every line how pleasantly they greet strewing thy paths with roses red and white to deck thy silverstreams of fluent wit and entertain the graces of thy mind o may thy early head sweet shelter find under the umbrage of those verdant bays ordaind for sacred poesys sweet lays such are thy lines in such a curious dress composd so quaintly that if i may guess none save thine own should dare t approach the press i gough to the ingenious author a sour and austere kind of men there be that would outlaw the laws of poesy and from a commonwealths wellgovernd lists some grave and too much severe platonists would exclude poets and have enmity with the souls freedom ingenuity these are so much for wisdom they forget that heaven allowth the use of modest wit these think the author of a jest alone is the man that deserves damnation holding mirth vicious and to laugh a sin yet we must give these cynics leave to grinwhat will they think when they shall see thee in the plains of fair elysium sit among a crowned troop of poets and a throng of ancient bards which souldelighting choir sings daily anthems to apollos lyre amongst which thou shalt sit and crowned thus shalt laugh at cato and democritus thus shall thy bays be superscribd my pen did not alone make plays but also men e b to his friend the author bless me you sacred sisters what a throng of choice encomiums s pressd such as was sung when the sweet singer stesichorus livd upon whose lips the nightingale survivd what makes my sickly fancy hither hie unless it be for shelter when the eye of each peculiar artist makes a quest after my slender judgment then a jest dissolves my thoughts to nothing and my pains has its reward in adding to my stains but as the river of athamas can fire the sullen wood and make its flames aspire so the infused comfort i receive by th tie of friendship prompts me to relieve my fainting spirits and with a full sail rush mongst your argosies despite of hail or storms of critics friend to thee i come i know th hast harbour i defy much room besides ill pay thee fort in grateful verse since that thou art wits abstract ill rehearse nothing shall wool your ears with a long phrase of a sententious folly for to raise sad pyramids of flattery that may be condemnd for the sincere prolixity let envy turn her mantle and expose her rotten entrails to infect the rose or pinelike greenness of thy extant wit yet shall thy homers shield demolish it upon thy quill as on an eagles wing thou shalt be led through th airs sweet whispering and with thy pen thou shalt engrave thy name better than pencil in the list of fame i tatham on master rawlins and his tailor in the rebellion in what a strange dilemma stood my mind when first i saw the tailor and did find it so wellfraught with wit but when i knew the noble tailor to proceed from you i stood amazd as one with thunder struck and knew not which to read you or your book i wonder how you could being of our race so eaglelike look phœbus in the face i wonder how you could being so youngand teeming yet encounter with so strong and firm a story twould indeed have provd a subject for the wisest that had lovd to suck at aganippe but go on my best of friends and as you have begun with that is good so let your aftertimes transcendent be apollo he still shines on the best wits and if a momus chance on this thy volume scornfully to glance melpomene will defend and you shall see that virtue will at length make envy flee i knight to his ingenious friend master rawlins the author of the rebellion what need i strive to praise thy worthy frame or raise a trophy to thy lasting name were my bad wit with eloquence refind when i have said my most the mosts behind but that i might be known for one of them which do admire thy wit and love thy pen i could not better show forth my goodwill than to salute you with my virgin quill and bring you something to adorn your head among a throng of friends who oft have read your learned poems and do honour thee and thy bright genius how like a curious tree is thy sweet fancy bearing fruit so rare the learned still will covet momus no share shall have of it but end his wretched days in grief cause now he seeth th art

the infanta of spain maria wife to eleazar and daughter to alvero the scene spain preface this play was printed in o and with the name of christopher marlowe on the title as the author than which few things are more improbable yet dilke who printed the piece in his series believed it to be really by marlowe and considered it superior to his faustus he observes in particular passages and some whole scenes faustus has great beauties but it must have been principally indebted for its success to the superstitious ignorance of the times lusts dominion is a much better play dilke continues it was altered by mrs behn and performed at the duke of yorks theatre in under the title of abdelazar and probably furnished hints for the admirable tragedy of the revenge but notwithstanding the luxuriance of imagery in the first scenes the exquisite delicacy of the language that is throughout given to maria and the great beauty of parts it has too much of king cambyses veinrape andmurder and superlatives and if the stage be intended as a portraiture of real character such representations tend only to excite a disgust and abhorrence of human nature with the exception of the innocent maria the fiery philip isabella alvero and hortenzo there is not one with whom our feelings hold communion the open representation of the devil in faustus is less offensive than the introduction of him here in the garb of a moor but the philanthropy of our ancestors was not shocked at any representation of an african or an israelite mr collier remarks thomas dekker in partnership with william haughton and john day was the author of the spanish moors tragedy which malone by a strange error calls the spanish morris but he gives the right date january the mistake was more important than it may appear at first sight as the spanish moors tragedy was most likely the production called lusts dominion not printed until and falsely attributed to marlowe a spanish moor is the hero of it and the date in henslowe of january corresponds with that of a tract upon which some of the scenes are even verbally founded that marlowe who was killed in and could not therefore be the author of it requires no

for believing it to be from shirleys pen nor is it included in gifford and dyces edition of that writer the plot is taken from the story of plangus in sir philip sydneys arcadia the same subject had

fathers love with half that joy he usd to do ara tis now about a week i have observd this alteration it shakes him like an ague once in two days but holds him longer than a fit o th gout they whisper about the court as if the king had chid him for it and now at length had found his haunts ino a poor discovery who might not find em out that would be so uncivil i was about to follow him but thought it an ignoble way beneath the name of friendship and so desisted about four days ago meeting him i th long gallery i askd him how he did taking me by the hand he wrung it and after a sigh or two told me not very well but he had businessand so we parted i saw him not again in twenty hours after and then i askd him where hed been so long he told me as if he was ashamed to deny me such a poor request i must not know and when i told him his often absence was observd is it saith he i cannot help it but it shall no more be so and at the last he stole away since when i saw him not nic o this wicked peace inophilus is there no hopes of war to lie at home to see our armours rust we could keep the prince sober and merry tooif he would but exchange his court for a camp ino the king is old and doats upon his son is loth to venture him to danger yet at this time there is occasion the argives have refusd to pay their tribute and are for certain preparing for invasion some say they have got into iberia already ara nay then theres hopes if we could but find the prince with a buffcoat again i should be once more merry exeunt scene ii enter ephorbas the king rinatus eubulus and aramnes three lords eph see the ambassadors entertaind with such an evenness as should be usd to men we neither fear nor love let neither too much obsequiousness teach them insolency nor any illusage brand us with incivility stay you rinatus he sighs exeunt eubulus and aramnes open thy bosom and receive torrents of sorrow that lie like rocks of lead upon my soul honest rinatus experience bids me trust thee with a mighty secret thou canst not choose but know my son of late is much retird i do not like that youth should be thus melancholy let them enjoy themselves for age will come whose impotency will deny all pleasures i do believe he loves me ha rin yes doubtless better than sick men health or those who are pennd up in darkness love the sun eph i speak not as if i thought he did not for thou knowst i humour him afford him liberty enough i never chide him nor express the least dislike of any action am not i a gentle father methinks were i a son again to such a father i should not think he livd too long shouldst thou rinatus rin no more doth he upon my soul one command of yours would make him venture upon lightning nay almost make him act a sin a thing he fears to name eph i do believe thee but yet methinks should he be grown so impious there might be found excuses a crown is a temptation especially so near one tis not with princes as with other sons and i am told too hath not my hand the palsy doth a crown become grey hairs to be a king might make some men forswear all consciencebut i know plangus hath far nobler thoughts and yet an empire might excuse a parricide rin sir sure you are a stranger to your son for give me leave to say your fears are vain so great a virtue as the princes cannot anticipate his hopes by any sin honour and duty have been acquainted with him now too long to be divorcd some sycophants there are such creatures still will haunt the court i know love not the prince because he loves not them sir shut your ears to them they will betray you to your ruin jealousys a disease should be below a king as that which seizeth on the basest spirits o shut it from your soul one may read in story what dire effects the fury hath brought forth kings make away their only sons and princes their fathers and when they have done they may despair at leisure eph i do not think plangus hath plots or on my crown or me he was virtuous always and is still i hope but why is he so much from court then and alone too i do but ask the question rin it can be no design believe me sir for crowns are won by other courses aspirers must grow popular be hedgd about with their confederates then would he flatter you be jolly still as if no melancholy thought were in him a guilty conscience would then teach him policy and he would seek to take suspicion from all his carriages innocence makes him careless now eph thou hast almost resolvd me the tempest in my soul is almost laid and wants but time to calm it youth hath its whimsies nor are we to examine all their paths too strictly we went awry ourselves when we were young rin sir eph thou mayst be gone rinatus exit rinatus scene iii ephorbas solus the blessing of an honest servant this rinatus is truer unto me he loves the king as well as i ephorbas and may i live but to reward him for hes too honest for a court enter artesio how now artesio thy looks speak strong amazement i am with child to hear the news prythee be quick in the deliveryart the prince ant please your majesty eph what of him artesio art i have observd is much retird of late eph so have i too this is no news art and i can whisper in your ear the cause twas chance no policy of mine betrayd his privacies illoffices are not the engines i desire to rise by only love to the young prince makes me reveal them ephnay nay without apology if it were treason it should not go down the sooner for all the gilded preparation nor am i of so feminine a humour as to mistrust affection delivered bluntly plain meaning should be plainly told bad wares may have false lights good can abide the day art but i know the nature of my office though kings still hug suspicion in their bosoms they hate the causers love to hear secrets too yet the revealers still fare the worse being either thought guilty of ends or weakness and so esteemd by those they tell them to either unfit or dangerous to be trusted perhaps sir when the prince and you are friends again youll tell me that had my love been real i should have whisperd the princes errors to himself eph without a syllable of prologue more or i shall verify your fears art in this brave city take it as brief as may be there lives a beauty fit to command them that command the world and might be alexanders mistress were he yet alive and had added empires as large as his desires shes but a private merchants wife yet the prince is so far gravelld in her affection i fear eph then there is hopes i may recall him love is a childish evil though the effects are dangerous a princes errors grown public will be scandalous poor boy perhaps the jealous husband may commit a murder i would not have him cut off so young love should be princes recreation not their business what physic must we give him for his cure art i dare not counsel you but in my poor judgment some gentle fatherly persuasions will work upon so good a nature eph couldst thou but possibly effect how i might take him napping art that is beyond my skillbut i can show you the house and time he walks from hence in which will be about an hour hence for then her husband comes home from the rialto eph time will not tarry for a king lets go exeunt scene iv ino what is become of this young prince or where doth he bestow himself doth he walk invisible where have i not been to look him the horses are in the stables his page and i at home too that usd to be as inseparable companions enter nicetes aramnes ara well met gentlemen where is the hermit plangus nic we cannot tell nor have we been to seek him if at the court we should hear presently if not we might be too officious in his search and our inquiry might make his absence but so much the more notorious and im confident hes well his virtue guards him still from all mischances ino though his companys the dearest thing i love yet for his good i could digest his absence but that i doubt a mighty mischief might spring from this small grain of indiscretion the king is old and there are knaves about the court that if he knew it not would tell him so and men conscious to themselves of a deficiency are still most jealous of a growing worth perhaps a thinking father for plodding is old ages sickness may take notice of his sons retirement and misconstrue it so nothing is impossible heaven send it otherwise ara this care becomes you sir but i dare swear tis needless the king is but an ill dissembler and had he but the least thought of such a thing hed hide it less than the sun conceals his brightness besides a man as great as ephorbas is whose rule of living hath been directed by the line of virtue cannot mistrust that vice in his own son of which himself was never guilty had his younger years been tainted with inordinate desires or had his crown been the effect of some audacious crime perhaps his guilty conscience might have mistrusted but tis impossible where there is no guilt to fear a punishment ino you speak my hopes but this for certain gentlemen the king who was admired for his matchless sleeping whose night no noise disturbd and it was difficult to wake before his hour sleeps but unquietly of late will start at midnight and cry plangus is greedy after news and walks unevenlyand sometimes on the sudden looks behind him and when one speaks to him scarcely marks one syllable surely the mind of some distemper shakes his soul into this looseness enter messenger mes my lord the prince desires to meet you half an hour hence i th gallery ino me mes yes my lord ino i shall your servant captains all yours my lord exeunt at several doors scene v plangus andromana plan it cannot be so late and believet the sun is set my dear and candles have usurpd the office of the day plan indeed methinks a certain mist like darkness hangeth on my eyelids but too great lustre may undo the sight a man may stare so long upon the sun that he may look his eyes out and certainly tis so with me i have so greedily swallowd thy light that i have spoild my own and why shouldst thou tempt me to my ruin thus as if thy presence were less welcome to me than day to one who tis so long ago he saw the sun hath forgot what light is love of thy presence makes me wish this absence phœbus himself must suffer an eclipse and clouds are still foils to the brightest splendour some short departure will like to a river stoppd make the current of our pleasures run the higher at our next meeting plan alas my dearest tell those so that know not what it is to part from blessing bid not him surfeit to taste healths sweetness that knows what tis to groan under a disease and then let us stand and outface danger since you will have it so despise report and contemn scandals into nothing which vanish with the breath that utters em love is above these vanities should the innocent thing my husband take thee here he could not spite me but by growing jealous and jealousys blackest effect would be a cloister perhaps to kill me too but thats impossible i cannot die so long as plangus loves meyet say this piece of earth should play the coward and fall at some unlucky stroke love would transport my better half to its centre in plangus heart and i should live in him but sir you have a fame to lose which should be a princes only care and darling which should have an eternity beyond his life if he should take that from you i should be killed indeed plan why dost thou use these arguments to bid me go yet chain me to thy tongue while the angellike music of thy voice entring my thirsty ears charms up my fears to immobility tis more impossible for me to leave thee than for this carcase to quoit away its gravestone when it lies destitute of a soul t inform it mariners might with far greater ease hear whole shoals of sirens singing and not leap out to their destruction than i forsake so dangerous a sweetness and i will be dumb then plan i will be deaf first i have thought a way now ill run from hence and leave my soul behind me it shall be soand yet it shall not neither what shall a husband banish a prince his house for fear a husband tis but an airy title i will command there shall be no such thing and then andromana is mine or his or any mans she will herself these ceremonies fetter the world and i was born to free it shall man that noble creature be afraid of words things himself made shall sounds a thing of seven small letters give check ta princes will and did you not promise me dear sir have you not sworn too you would not stay beyond the time have oaths no more validity with princes let me not think so plan come i will go thou shalt not ask in vain but let us kiss at parting it may be our last perhaps i cannot now move one foot though all the furies should whip me forward with their snakes woman thou stolst my heartjust now thou stolst it a cannon bullet might have kissd my lips and left me as much life the king having listened comes in softly are we betrayd what art speak or resolve to die king a wellwisher of the princes plan the king it cannot behe starts king though thou hast thrown all nature off i cannot whats my duty ungracious boy hadst been the offspring of a sinful bed thou mightst have claimd adultry as inheritance lust would have been thy kinsman and what enormity thy looser life could have been guilty of had found excuse in an unnatural conception prythee hereafter seek another father ephorbas cannot call him son that makes lust his deity had i but known but we are hoodwinkd still to all mischances i should have had a son that would make it his study to embrace corruption and take delight in unlawful sheets i would have huggd a monster in mine arms before thy mother good o heavens what will this world come to at last when princes that should be the patterns of all virtue lead up the dance to vice what shall we call our own when our own wives banish their faith and prove false to us have i with so much care promisd myself so pleasing a spring of comfort and are all those blossoms nippd and buds burnt up by th fire of lust and sin have i thus long laboured against the billows that did oppose my growing hopes and must i perish in the havens mouth no gulf but this to be devoured in could not youths inclination find out another rock to split itself upon hadst thou huggd drunkenness the wit or mirth of company might have excusd it prodigality had been a sin a prince might have been proud in compared to this or had thy greener years incited thee to treason and attempt a doubting fathers crown t had been a noble vice ambition runs through the veins of princes it brings forth acts as great as themselves and it spurs on to honour and resolves great things but thisthis lechery is such a thing sin is too brave a name for it a prince i might say son but let that pass and dare to show himself to nought but darkness and black chambers whose motions like some planet are all eccentric not two hours together in his own sphere the courtbut i am tame to talk thus begone with as much speed as a coward would avoid his death and never more presume to look upon this woman upon this whore thou losest both thy eyes and me else plangus is going out but comes again plan o sir the reverence that i owe my father and the injury i have done this gentlewoman had charmd me up to silence but i must speak something for her honour when i have done command me to the altarwhilst i confess you tainted me with sin i did applaud you and condemn myself it looked like a fathers carebut when you usd that term of whore to her that stands there i would have given ten thousand kingdoms you had had no more relation to me than hath the northern to the southern pole i should have flown to my revenge swifter than lightning but i forbear and pray imagine not what i had done king upon my life shes very handsome aside plan to be a whore is more unknown to her than what is done in the antipodes she is so pure she cannot think a sin nor ever heard the name to understand it king no doubt these private meetings were to read her moral lectures and teach her chastity plan nay give me leave sir i do not say my addresses have been all so virtuous for whatsoever base desires a flaming beauty could kindle in a heart were all alive in me and prompted me to seek some ease by quenching burnings hotter than ætna imagine but a man that had drunk mercury and had a fire within his bones whose blood was hotter than the melted ore if he should wish for drink nay steal it too could you condemn him eph marrid do they say aside plan i did endure a heat seas could not cool it would have killd a salamander then taught both impudence and wit i singled out my foe usd all the arts that love could think upon and in the end found a most absolute repulse king well plangus youth excuses the first fault but a relapse exceeds all pardon exeunt king and plangus scene vi and cursd be old age and he that first numberd fourscore what devil

or to what end soever they never thrive libacer we are undone undone the king hath found his son here and i have lost him to eternity lib you women are the shallowest creatures you never look beyond the present rome was not built in one day madam greatness is never sweet that comes too easily should plangus be a fool now and obey his father pox o this virtue it spoils most men living we have hopes yet revenge is something and if my old trade fail not princes are mortal as well as other men yet my soul inspires me with half a confidence that leon hath not died in vain i use to see as far

well the persons were of less concernment he might have let you stayd till you had gatherd an army fit for your command and sent some petty things upon this expedition whose loss would have been nothing and of whom it might have been recorded in our story as an honour that they died monuments of the kings folly but let that pass youll say perhaps you only have a spirit fit for such undertakings i wish you had not your want then would not be half so grievous but here is the prodigy you must fight them presently come tis a project put into the kings head by some who have a plot on

doth the sun deserve to be a light to all the world can virtue deserve honour or labour riches can gods merit altars it might have been a puzzling question to them whose ears have not been blessd with plangus worth but this is so below him king but say he loves thee and i dare not say so for when i think a prince pretends to such poor things as i am i feel an ice runs through my veins and my blood curdles into flakes of snow and bids me fear himnot with an awe or reverence but as a spotted sinful thing which is the worse for being great tis such a fear as i should conceive gainst an armed ravisherking these things may be expected lady i confess from blood that boils in flames hot as the sun in scorching libra or sturdy hercules when he unmaidend fifty in one night but from a man whose years have tamd those vices whose love is dotage and not lust who doth adore a handsome virtue and pays his vows tot you should have other hopes plangus is young a soldier and by consequence something which youth excuses but ephorbas hath left these toys behind him when he shook off his youth and sir now my fears are out o virtue are there just powrs which men adore and throw away their prayrs upon

than their clothes by far though their valour had put on all the bravery that soldiers ever wore the prince whose presence breathed new fire into these flaming spirits resolvd to meet the enemy with his handful and with a winged speed fell down to th elean straits determining to try it with him there his soldiers also true sons of war contemning so great odds when victory and their country was to crown the conquerors whetted their eager valours with impatient expectation of the enemy who trusting to his multitude came on wingd both with scorn and anger to see that paucity should dare dispute victory against their odds plangus who though he saw yet could not fear destruction and scornd to avoid it when the king commanded him to meet it marshalld his army to the best advantage and having given zopiro the left wing the body to evarnes himself chose out the right because he would be opposite to argo and keeping a reserve as great as could be hopd for from so small a companynot above five hundred men he gave the command of them to zenon who with his fellows took it ill they should be so long idle and had not the honour to be thought worthy to die with the most forward and would no question have refused the charge but that the smiling prince promisd them they should have time to die words here were useless nor had he time to use them rin what was inophilus idle all this while mes i only heard the prince wish just as hespurred his horse against the valiant argo he had fewer by a thousand men so he had inophilus rin o traitorous boy mess the prince and argo met and like two mighty tides encountered here death put on her sable livery and the two gallants whose valour animated each army bandied a long time with equal force till at last great argo fell and on a sudden multitudes of men accompanid him so that the wing went presently to rout and execution zopiro also and evarnes having slain their opposite leaders breathd death and destruction to their reeling foes thus flushd with victory and blood th iberians revelld thorough the flying field till there came on the enemys reserve of twenty thousand men who fresh and lusty grinded their teeth for anger at their fellows overthrow and pouring on our weary soldiers turnd the stream of victory but the princes valour and good fortune soon oercame this opposition and having rallied his broken troops went to relieve his friends who had fard worse when presently he saw evarnes who had pild up enemies about him as an obelisk of his own death and victory fall bleeding at his foot and having kissd it with his dying lips entreated him to save himself for a more happy day and died twas not long after the gallant zenon who had performd that day deeds of eternal fame and with his few spite of opposition thrice chargd and routed some thousands of the enemy expird which when the prince beheld weeping for anger he flew amongst his enemies sustaind only by the greatness of his courage for blood and strength had both forsook him he spent that spark of life was left in him in slaughter and revenge when leaning on his weapons point that droppd with blood as fast as he he then conjurd me with all speed only to tell the king i saw him die worthy of his father and himself a horn without a shout eph o heaven what mean these acclamations what do a shout again the iberians welcome their bloody conquerors with so much joy scene vii enter plangus inophilus and zopiro captains eph o o he faintsrin o cowardly boy for that base word includes all baseness doth not shame kill thee or fear chill thy dastard blood to an ice at sight of that most noble injurd ghost tis well dear plangus if thy divinity deserve not a more lasting name that thou art come to take revenge on that most traitorous son ins fathers presence who detests his baseness more than thyself can do plan excuse us dear rinatus that wonder froze to such a silence if when we expected such a welcome as had that roman son whose mother died for joy to see him we found so cold an entertainment something made us lookd upon so like an inconvenience that we could not but put on some small amazement eph and do i hear thee speak again and see thee or only dream a happiness whose reality stars and my genius deny me or art thou plangus angel come to rouse me from despair plan sir pray believe it and be not backward in th entertainment of these soldiers if you esteemt a happiness in a word you are a conqueror and th audacious argives have paid their lives as sacrifices to your offended sword eph a messenger of comfort to a despairing lover is a less acceptable thing than this thy presence if what yon fellow told me were untruth thy welcome sight hath amply made amends for those tormenting fears he put me to but if it were not let me know what chance redeemd you plan if you have heard how things then went when i sent away that messenger eph yes i have heard it plan then know when death and our own fates had sworn our ruin and we like some strong wall that long resists the iron vomits of the flaming cannon at last shakes itself into a dreadful ruin to those who throw it down so had the iberians with valour great as the cause they fought for strove with a noble envy who should first outgo his fellow in slaughtering the argives at last oppressd with multitude and toil we sunk under the unequal burden then was our emulation changd and who before strove to outdo each other now eagerly contended to run the race of death first sir there it was i and many other braver captains fell being one wound from head to foot o then it was inophilus came in with about twenty other gallants and with what speedthe nimble lightning flies from east to west redeemd this bleeding trunk which the insulting argive had encompassd blown up with victory and pride he with a gallantry like none but great inophilus being bravely backd by his own soldiers whose actions spoke them more than men had not inophilus been by redeemd the honour of a bleeding day and thus are now our troops as little in number as their valour great enrichd with victory blood and jewels of which the opposite army wanted no store returnd with the renown of an achievement as full of glory and honour to the conquerors as ruin to the argives ino my liege had this action and my merit been so great as our prince would make it i then might own it and expect reward but it was so small so much below my duty that i must upon my knees beg pardon that i came no sooner eph this is a prodigy beyond whatever yet was wrote in story inophilus we have been too backward in cherishing thy growing virtue we will hereafter mend it and dear rinatus be proud of thy brave son and let the people honour the remaining army we shall esteem it as a favour done to us we have a largess for your valorous captains you have not fought in vain this day let our court put on its greatest jollity and let none wear a discontented brow for where a frown is writ well think it reason to say that face hath characters of treason exeunt act iii scene enter plangus and inophilusino but sir when you consider shes a woman plan o dear inophilus let earth and heavn forget there are such things or if they ever name them let it be with a curse heavy as are the ills they act a mandrakes note would ring a better peal of music in my ears than those two syllables pronouncd again ino pray sir put off this humour this peevish pet and reason tamely sir youve lost a wench and will you therefore lose yourself too hear me but patiently a word plan prythee go teach the galleyslaves that word things that dare own no thought beyond their chains and stand in fear of whipping and wanting bread bid them be tame and patient that fry in sulphur tis a word ive forsworn to know the meaning of or if i must tis but to shun it and hate it more o were thy wrongs as great as mine inophilus or didst thou love but half so well as plangus thou wouldst instil into me the poison of revenge and puff me up with thought of vengeance till i did burst and like a breaking cloud spread a contagion on those have injurd me ino why this were handsome in some countryfellow whose soul is dirty as the thing hes mad for twere pretty in a lady that had lost her dog her dog but plan i know what thou wouldst say but for plangus o tis for none but him to be so those that have injurd me are persons i once held dearer than my eyes but how much greater was my love so much more is th offence wounds from our friends are deepest had any but my fatherand yet methinks that name should have protected me or was it made only to secure offenders my life was his he gave it me my honour too i could have parted with but las my love was none of mine no more than vows made to a deity and not performd and for that creature who must be lost for ills through which i must make way to my revenge had she betrayd my honour to anything but him that gave me being she had made me half amends in that my way to vengeance had been open now i am spurrd forward to revenge by fury and yet held in by the rein of a foolish piety that doth no man good but them that use it not tis like the misers idol it yielded him no gold till he had broke the head off nay inophilus one secret more and the horror of it blow thee from earth to heaven where there are no such things as women twill turn thy soul the inside outward i cannot get it out prythee what ist inophilusino alas i know not sir plan do but imagine the worst of ills earth ever groand under a sin nothing but woman nay such a woman as andromana durst think on and it is that ino how revenge transports you princes have lost their mistresses before nay and to those have not such right to them as hath ephorbas to what plangus hath who could command her if not ephorbas plan but i haveo inophilus i burst yet it will outdost thou not see it here unbuttons his doublet o i have known andromana as ephorbas did last night ino why sir the sin done by your father is not yours if you could not help it plan why there it is tis that which gnaws me here but i swore by all the gods that she was as innocent from my unclean embraces as is the newfalln snow or ermines that will meet ten deaths before one spot i made my father think the thoughts of angels were less innocent than she no it was i betrayd him his virtue was too great to have suspected it how do i look inophilus ino like some blessd man that grievd for others sins could out of a good nature part with half his own whiteness to purge the others stains plan now thou soothest and like some flattering glass presentst me to advantage i am in short one born to make iberia unhappy had i as black a face as is my soul you would find in respect of it ægyptians were snowwhite methinks i hear heaven tell me i am slow and it is time i had begun revenge ephorbas has done him wrong who lovd him more than heaven or his happiness and would have run out of the world to have left him free to whatever he would lay claim to but andromana nay she also had been his so it could have been without a sin but she knew the sin she acted and yet did it and yet she lives free from the stroke of thunder is there such a thing as heaven or such a one as justice dwells there and can i ask the question o the tameness of a conscience loaded with sin which reasons and talks when it should do but i will be revengd and thus i begin inophilus he drawsbe sure when i am dead to meet my ghost and do as that instructs thee twill tell all the particulars of my revenge who must die first who last and what way too i have my lesson perfect he leans the pommel on the ground to fall on it inophilus kicks it by with his foot ino is this the revenge befits great plangus plan had this been done two days ago thou durst as well have met the lightning naked as have opposed my will thus he draws ino hear me ask me no questions nor answer me or if you do by heavn ill never speak more it is revenge youd have and tis a great one a very noble one to kill yourself be confident your greatest foes wish nothing more when afterages come to hear your story what will they say just as they did of cato he durst not look great cæsar in the face so plangus was afraid and died a very pretty story and much to a mans credit for shame dear plangus let friendship use that title show your great soul the world believes youre master of and i dare swear you are in this action nay rally up yourself and fight it stoutly shake from your mind revenge and having laid that passion by put on that virtue the world admires in you tis now the time to show it the sun broke from a cloud doubles his light and fire the more resisted flames more bright andromana has injurd you scorn her therefore as though she had done nothing id not do her the favour to have one thought of her or could be troubled at that she did as for your father sir besides the tie of nature he knows not he hath wrongd you or if he doth tis love that causd him a word that once made an excuse with plangus for what offence soever plan thou hast wrought upon me and i am resolved to live a day or two more but if i like it notwell ill go try to sleep a little perhaps that mayi am strangely melancholy prythee lie down by me inophilus im safe while in thy company exeunt scene ii enter plangus as from sleep plan lord how this spirit of revenge still haunts me and tempts me with such promisd opportunity and magnifies my injuries sometimes it calls me coward and tells me conscience in princes who are injurd like myselfis but an excuse they find for what is in truth poorness of spirit or something baser it tells me tis a sin to be good when all the world is bad it makes me look upon myself whilst wearing this garb of virtue like some old antiquary in clothes that are out of fashion in iberia but i will not yield to it i know it is a greater glory to a mans self and he that courts opinion is of a vulgar spirit to disobey than satisfy an appetite which i know is sinful good heaven guard me how am i tempted enter andromana to put on my former temper but thus i fling it from me throws away his sword scene iii and why how now prince if you part with your darling so easily there is small hopes but you have thrown all love behind you plan heaven how shes alterd i that once swore jove from the welltund sphere neer heard such harmony as i did when she spake methinks i can now in comparison of her voice count screechowls music or the croaking toad aside and who ist you speak of sir plan tempt me not madam with another word for by heaven you know im apt being incensd wake not those wrongs that bellow louder in my soul than wretches in the brazen bull or jove who speaks in thunder those wrongs my goodness had half laid asideor if you do i have a soul dares what you dare tempt me to and sir i must speak though jove forbad me with a flash of lightning you think perhaps sir i have forgot my plangus but sir i have infinitely injurd you and could not satisfy my conscienceif i should say my love too i should not lie till i had askd your pardon plan madam the faults forgiven and forgotten without you move me to remembert with a worse apology live and enjoy your sins and the angry gods nay the severest plague i wish you is that you may die without one cross for afflictions commonly teach virtues to them that know them not while prosperous secure without one thought or sense of a repentance and methinks you have a steely temper on to thatwhich the other day you wore when you were more soft than down of bees but sir if you but knew the reason why ive done the action which you perhaps call treason to our loves you would forbear such language plan reason no doubt the man that robs a church or profanes altars hath reason for what he doth to satisfy your lust you have that reason madam and that i have loved you once i call heaven my own heart and you to witness now by that love by all those vows have passd betwixt us hear me plan o heaven is that a conjuration things you have broke with as much ease as politicians do maxims of religion but i will hear to know you and to hate you more speak on and you know whilst leon livd whose due they were i out of love resignd my love and honour unto your plan lust madam and i know not sir your eloquence gave it that title then how many dangers walkd i fearless through to satisfy your pleasures your very will nay more your wordnay if i thought by sympathy a thought of yours that i imagind you might blush to speak i made it straight my own and workd and studied as much to put it into act as doth a gamester upon loss to compass money at last we were betrayd sir to your fathers spies who denied us afterwards those opportunities we stole before befriended by my husbands ignorance now was i brought to that which is the worst of ills a seeing but not enjoying of that which i held dearest to see you daily and to live without you was a death many degrees beyond my own i knew the love was great so great i durst not own it nay more i knew it was noble too so noble i knew my husband being dead you would not stick to ask your fathers leave for public marriage plan heaven and the gods can witness i intended it and nay farther yet i knew your fathers love which would not have denied you anything would also have granted that plan madam you riddle strangely and when i had forecast these easy possibilities i yet foresaw one thing that crossed our designs that was a sense of honour i had in me methought in honour i could not condescendyou should debase yourself so low it pleasd me better to be your mistress than your queen and stoln embraces without the scandal of a public eye were sweeter than those which might bring upon mefor rising greatness is still enviedthe rancour of the people and consequent distaste against their prince sir now we may act safely what might have been less secure your fathers name gives a protection or if that startle you well call him husband plan are you in earnest and as serious as love can be plan then i want words to tell you how i hate you i would sooner meet megæra tween a pair of sheets and can you think i should have so small pity as to be false unto my fathers bed that i lovd you once i confess with shame and that i should have done so still had you preservd those flames i think of now with horror but for those sins and whatsoever else i must repent i shall no doubt have great occasion when i shall see th kingdom envelopd in those swarms of plagues your sins call down and feel a share of them myself for heavens sake madam for my fathers sake nay for my own if that have any interest learn now at last a virtue that may make us as happy as much as hitherto unfortunate and render your story to posterity so burnishd with your shining goodness that their eyes may not perceive the error of your former years perhaps i then shall have a reverence for you as great as any son hath for a fathers wife you wonder lady to see me talk thus different from what you saw me half an hour ago i lookd upon myself as one that had lost a blessing but heaven hath been happier to me for i am now so far from thinking you one that i look upon you as a plague no sin of good ephorbas could deserve but love to you and sir plan answer me not in words but deeds i know you always talkd unhappily and if your heart dare do whats ill i know it can well teach your tongue excuses exit plangus scene iv and and is my love then scornd the chaos of eternal night possess my breast that it may not see to startle at any undertakings though they would make medusas snakes curl into rings for fear if greatness have inspired me with thoughtsof a more brave revenge they shall be acted a husbands murder was such a puny sin i blush to speak it but it was great enough for a merchants wife a queen must be more daring in her revenge nor must her wrath be pacifid under a whole kingdoms ruin scene v enter libacer my better genius thou art welcome as a draught of water to a thirsty man i neer had need of thee till now muster those devils dwell within thy breast and let them counsel me to a revenge as great as is my will to act it lib madam leave words the rest you take in breathing makes your anger cool out with it and if i do it not if i startle at any ill to do you service though it be to kill my mother let me be troubled with the plague of a tender conscience and lie sick of repentance a half year after and what need i tell thee more plangus must die and after him ephorbas because he is his father lib madam he shall but give me leave to ask you how he for whom alone of all the world you had a passion is now become an object of your hatred so great as others must die because they have relation to him and the air is hot yet with those words i profferd him in satisfaction and he refusd it what need i speak ist safe that he should live knows so much by us lib he had been happy had he never known what virtue meant i wonder that paltry thing is not banishd earth it neer did any good yet beggarys a blessing tot whoeer grew rich by virtue madam we are not troubled with it but to our businessi have thought a way you know his father loves him tis he shall ruin him and lets alone for him and pish pish that cannot be lib these women are always with their cannots what cannot be have you but read the sophy you will find that haly o how i hug that fellows name ruind great mirza by his father and his father by his son that great politician while all the court flamd round about him sat secure and laughd like those throw fireworks among the waving people that have nothing but fire and smoke about them and yet not singe one hair indeed he fell at lasttis true but he was shallow in that part o th plot what have we his example for but to learn by it praise plangus to ephorbas then so far that first he may fear for his kingdom and if you do proceed till he grew jealous of his bed twill do the better the king is coming i must be gone exit libacer scene vi enter ephorbas eph how fares andromana im glad this greatness sits so well about thee my court was blessd that hour i knew thee first well live and still grow happy we shall flourish like some spreading tree that shall never cease till its proud height oerlook the skies i hope i bad fair for a boy tonight how happy should i count myself could i but leave my kingdom something that had thy image int and sir never think iberia can be happy in another son when such a prince as plangus lives the heir who is the subject of all mens prayrsnay the deserver too theres not a man or woman in the kingdom hath one good wish within their breast but they straight bestow it upon plangus a prince whom mothers show their little children as something they should learn betime to worship and admire eph i know andromana but and sir virtues perfection is at the height in him whatever after ages bear or give the name of worth to must if compard to him be but as foils to set his glory off the brighter nor are the men only thus taken with him theres not a lady in the land but sighs with passion for him and dreams on him anights husbands grow jealous of him yet with joy that they are plangus rivals eph all this is nothing men talkd as loud of me when i was young and yea but they say sir you were not half so mincing in your carriage nor so majestic besides eph i hope they do not make comparisons starts and sir i thought we could not have discoursd on a more welcome theme than what is full of plangus eph no more you cannot let him as a less starenjoy his splendour but it must not be so great to darken me but prythee do they compare us then and youre discomposd siri have done ephnay nothing but the remembrance of a foolish dreamwhat say they and why sir some went so far to say they wonderd a lady of my years could marry the father though a king when i might have had plangus himself eph they did not and then i confess i blushd and had been out of temper but that i thought it might be the court fashion to talk boldly ephthis story jumpd just with my dream tonight but methought i saw him threatning to kill me cause thou hadst married me but the young saucy boy shall know i hold my sceptre strong enough to crush him into atoms did they not name inophilus and i think they did he had some share of praises too but it was so as gleanings to a loading cart they sometimes fell beside eph then i am satisfied tis an aspiring youth tis something that unites plangus and him so i must be speedy in resolves exit ephorbas scene vii and who waits without there enter libacer o art thou come stay let me breathe or else lib nay spare your pains i know it all i saw him drink it with as great greediness as usurers do unthrifts lands or jealous husbands confirm their cuckoldships by ocular testimony and it took most rarely beyond our hopes ill leave the rest to thee thou art so fortunate in

went he this way lib yes sir he is going out but turns short plan but dost not thou know what movd him lib i heard some such words as these my rival in the kingdomtheres evidence against him the peoples lovedeserving is a crime and somewhat else my fear made me forget plan who was there with him lately lib i cannot tell but about a quarter of an hour ago he askd for you and every time he namd

or die for it concerned your life which she held dearer than her own plan i value it not but speak the mystery lib when first her lips began to move a blush oerflowd her face as if her heart had sent her tainted blood to seek a passage out then with a showr of tears she told me how inordinate desires had made her but this morning tempt you to th acting of a sin she would not name and that your virtue had so wrought upon her she had not left one thing unchangd she loves you still but with affection that carries honour and converted thoughts and next she bad me whisper in your ear for time was short that if you lovd her or yourself or intended to cherish the peoples growing hopes you should not come when the king sent for you for something had incensed him so highly against you that there was mighty danger in it she bad me haste for time would not permit her to say more i was scarce out o th chamber when your father came and askd for you and bad me seek you out with speed sir i should be most proud to serve you plan i thank thee friend but prythee tell thy mistress innocence knows no fear tis for guilty souls to doubt their safety if she would have me safe my only way is by present appearance to clear myself for i believe my false accusers wish nothing more than that i should be absent lib the devils in him sure he guesseth so right asideshe told me so sir and would have wishd you to it but that there was a way to serve you better by she sayth ephorbas told her a few minutes hence hed call a council where theyd consult about you the place is hangd so that behind the wall sir you may stand secure and hear what passeth and according to what they determine you may provide for your safety only for more security she wisheth you would arm yourself sir pray resolve shell pacify the king that you appear not presently plan well i will be persuaded tell her i am resolvd i will not come lib happiness attend you half an hour hence ill wait upon you exit libacer plan we shall reward thee scene iv plan whence should this kindness come and on a sudden too a strange alteration she who a day ago forgot the vows her soul was fetterd in and but this morning tempted me to a sin i can scarce think on without fear should on an instant be careful for my safety and that from a principle of virtue too scene v enter inophilus ino who was that with you sir just now plan an honest fellow certainly but one i know not ino an honest fellow call you him if he have not rogue writ in great letters ins face i have no physnomy pray sir what was his business to you plan a message from andromana who out of love desires me not to go to my father because something hath put him in a fume against me ino did the king send for you plan he did so ino but upon her entreaty you forbore to go plan what then ino then you are mad sir and tacitly conspire to your own ruin do take an enemys advice and die the object both of their joy and scorn where areyour senses sir or pray whence springs this friendship of andromanas alas you should not measure her malice by the smallness of your own she has injurd you she knows it sir and though at present she enjoys her treachery she may soon fall beside it ephorbas is not immortal nor can she promise to herself security when you have power to call her ills in question weret nothing else her safety would make her to plot your death i hinder you in talking but pray begone and when you see your father speak boldly to him or youre gone for ever plan i tell thee once again inophilus since i have said i would not go both heaven and thee shall want a motive to make me stir one foot were danger just before me running with open jaws upon me and had my word been givn to remain here i would be forcd from life before my place ino here is a bravery now would make a man forswear all gallantry to fool away your life thus in a humour i met the court just now sir as full of whispers every mans eyes spoke strong amazement my fathers sent for with two other lords eubulus and anamedes and the courtgates are lockd resolve sir and command me something wherein i may have an occasion to serve you plan then i resolve to do as i am cautiond walk in ill tell thee more exeunt scene vi enter ephorbas and libacer eph what was his answer then lib tell him i am resolvd i will not come those were the very words sir ephtwas very pretty and resolute methinks if he be grown so stubborn already the next we must expect is action lib but yet he bids me if you askd why he came not to find some excuse or other eph he could find none himself then call in the lords we must be sudden in our execution but prythee one thing more who was there with him lib nobody but i met going to him young inophilus and heard one servant tell another in great haste their lord would speak with some o the captains o the army exitscene vii enter rinatus eubulus and anamedes eph sit down my lords we have business with you requires your hands and hearts both speed and counsel our dangers such that i could wisht had flown upon us without warning for so cross the fates are our safety must be bought at such a price that we must lose what is as dear to us almost as it tis plangus death or mine must secure the others life nay startle not if i am grown as wearisome to you as to him your calling is in vain my lords nor shall i labour longer to preserve a life denied me by the gods and you but if theres any here who hath a son brought to these years with so much care and love as mine hath been think what a grief it is to lose him and shed one tear with me but for that son to plume himself with feathers pluckd from his fathers wings would melt ones eyeballs yet plangus who hath vizarded his ends with virtue finding it useless now hath thrown it from him and openly attempts my crown and life when mischiefs wheel once runs how fast it speeds headlong to put in act the blackest deeds were my crown his had he my life to give though he would let me i would scorn to live eub sir we are called upon a great affair and if it be true the speed of our resolves shall be as great as it your majesty hath reignd so happily and long we will not think a time beyond it and such so great your virtue still hath been strangers have been enamourd and admird it our enemies that could have wishd it less yet have sat down with envy nor attempted aught against you knowing i am confident by such unjust attempts the gods would be their foes methinks tis therefore much less likely that plangus who hath hitherto been found a miracle of filial piety and one that we may say was born the heir to all your virtues all your goodness as well as the kingdom who counts it glory as much to be an honest man as a great prince i say for him who as he is your son and as we hitherto have found him full of worth and honour we cannot but behold as him in whom the spreading hopes of all iberia grow and promise to themselves a still green happiness that neer shall know what autumn or a naked winter means for him that hath scarce yet put off those clothes which still wear the badges of the great danger he was in not for himself my liege but you and us for had he wishd the ruin of his father and his country the argives would have done that for him and he not have been calld in questionbut when we must remember with what wings he flew to meet the torrent both against the counsel of his friends and his own hopes how love to you and us spurrd him on forward to those impossibilities which nothing but love and valour durst have attempted why then methinks tis strange yea very strange thus in a moment t have flung all nature off and all religion and that sir against you whom we all well know and think with fear but our fading hopes spring fresh from plangus must shortly pay your tribute to the grave nor that we doubt your majesty hath cause to apprehend a danger only tis wishd those who informd you were examind strictly and plangus sent for to answer for himself slanders like mists still vanish at the sight of innocents who bring their lies to light eph if an oration could have made him clear no doubt my fears are vain and we shall lie still sleeping in security as great and lasting as plangus and his accomplices can wish upon us nor wake till we are bound in the securest chains deaths fetters that i am old is true and plangus knows it he would have catchd a cannonbullet sooner else tween his naked hands than have provokd my fury but old age hath frozen me to an icy numbness yet shall he know my veins have fire as well as his and when incensd my eyes shoot as much poison too what you allege about his battle gainst the argives as an excuse it is a proof against him though thieves rob others yet they fight themselves for those that rob when strangers set on them and all unite against a common enemy had plangus private interest not held him to us no doubt hed have left us naked of all defence but an intestine fury to see the argives bear away the fruits of all his labours all his treasons shot him into despair and made him play a game was almost lost rather than give all oer besides that action hath endeard him to the people gaind him the soldiers hearts with so great ease the dangers nothing in respect o th rise he takes from hence to climb up to his ends and for the virtue that hath gulld us all id blush to speak it that a son of mine should ever be so base to seek a cloak for what he doth but that i have disclaimd all my relations to him and would adopt a cannibal sooner for a son than he the evidence we have is what we wish were less then might i hug my plangus and he me but since the fates and his own ills deny that intercourse what can remain but that we should proceed to sentence speedy as themselves and stop the ill which may strike when tis night or while tis calld today he knows his guilt too well and hath deniedto come that so he might be justified once disobeyd as father the next thing will be rebellion to me as his king scene viii enter libacer rin as sure as death this is one of the rogues that hath his roguery to act and comes in like something that hath brought news in th latter end of a play now shall we have some strange discovery how the rogue stares lib no sooner had we shut the gates my liege than an uncertain rumour spread among the people that plangus was in danger when if you ever saw a hive of bees how if you stir but one the whole swarm moves and testify their anger so straight whole crowds of people the greatest half not knowing what they came for swarmd to the gates and with confusd cries hinderd themselves from being understood till some having divers times cried plangus and some their prince all with one note made up a common voice and so continued till

period to an action of such high consequence d cit tis true but those many aggrievances aggravated with numerous petitions presented by our seville merchants wrought such strong effects upon the sweet compassionate nature of the good duke as endeared that resentment which he retained upon those merchants relation touching the infinitely surcharging losses which they had suffered through the hostile piracy of the salamancans as he made a solemn vow to engage himself in their quarrel and either revenge the injuries and indignities they had sustained or seal his just desires with the sacrifice of

vrsvla bartv bertie widow london printed by j m for henry herringman this forms part of the collected edition of the works in folio mentioned presentlypreface to the former edition thomas killigrew one of the sons of sir robert killigrew chamberlain to the queen was born at hanworth in the county of middlesex in the month of february although his writings are not wanting in those requisites which confer reputation on an author yet we are permitted to conclude that it was chiefly to his conversational and social qualities that killigrew owed his ascendancy at charles iis courtfirst abroad and afterwards in england hence sir john denham was probably led to write those lineshad cowley neer spoke killigrew neer writ combind in one theyd made a matchless wit but as we know for at least two generations the killigrews were all men and women of genius and were as remarkable too for their physical as for their intellectual graces killigrew seems to have been early intended for the court and to qualify him for rising there every circumstance of his education appears to have been adapted in the year while upon his travels he chanced to be at london and an eyewitness of the celebrated imposture of exorcising the devil out of several nuns belonging to a convent in that town of this transaction he wrote a very minute and accurate account still in ms in the pepysian library at magdalen college cambridge he was appointed pageofhonour to king charles i and faithfully adhered to his cause until the death of his master after which he attended his son in his exile to whom he was highly acceptable on account of his social and convivial qualifications he married mrs cicilia crofts one of the maidsofhonour to queen henrietta with this lady he had a dispute on the subject of jealousy at which thomas carew was present and wrote a poem introduced into the masque of cœlum britannicum and afterwards a copy of verses on their nuptials printed in his works it appears from the original documents still preserved that killigrew was with prince charles at paris in april and obtained from him a licence to travel dated april in he had a grant from james duke of york of the office of gentleman of the bedchamber and from to he was engaged in diplomatic negotiations at vienna and florence his papers as well as those which he addressed to the republic of venice are extant speaking of his mission to venice although says lord clarendon the king was much dissuaded from it but afterwards his majesty was prevailed upon only to gratify him killigrew that in that capacity he might borrow money of english merchants for his own subsistence which he did and nothing to the honour of his master but was at last compelled to leave the republic for his vicious behaviour of which the venetian ambassador complained to the king when he came afterwards to paris on his return from venice sir john denham wrote a copy of verses printed in his works bantering the foibles of his friend killigrew who from his account was as little sensible to the inconveniences of exile as his royal master but the curious preface to killigrews plays where under the thin veil of levity so strong a vein of seriousness seems to be perceptible tells a different story perhaps he wishes the public as much leisure to read his plays as he had to write thema banishment of twenty years one of the documents connected with the killigrews which have come down to us shows that in thomas received the freedom of the city of maastricht in holland this was perhaps a parting compliment when he prepared to return to england with his royal companion in exile at the restoration he was appointed groom of the bedchamber and became so great a favourite with his majesty that he was admitted into his company on terms of the most unrestrained familiarity and at times when audience was refused to the first ministers and even on the most important occasions it does not appear that he availed himself of his interest with the king either to amass a fortune or to advance himself in the state we do not find that he obtained any other preferment than the post of master of the revels which he held with that of groom of the bedchamber oldys very foolishly and absurdly says he was kings jester at the same time but although he might and certainly did entertain his majesty in that capacity it can scarce be imagined to have been in consequence of any appointment of that kind he died at whitehall on the th of march having in published a collected edition of his plays viz the prisoners a tragicomedy written at london and acted at the phœnix in drury lane claracilla a tragicomedy written in rome and acted at the phœnix in drury lane dedicated to his dear sister the lady shannon the princess or love at first sight a tragicomedy written in naples dedicated to his dear niece the lady anne wentworth wife to the lord lovelace the parsons wedding the pilgrim a tragedy written in paris

master in the noble science of wit plea mine laid about him with spick and span new arguments not like the same man his old sayings and precedents laid by wid thus armed then well stand and defy them wild wheres your points sure aunt this should be your weddingday for you have taken the man for better for worse wid no nephew this will not prove the day that we shall either give or take a ring care hang me if i know you can go back again with your honour wild or in justice refuse him liberty that has served out his time either marry him or provide for him for he is maimed in your service wid why servant sad youll arm my nephew has thrown the first dart at youcapt hast hit hast hit wild no captain twas too wide capt too wide marry hes an ill marksman that shoots wider than a widow jolly we are both in one hole captain but i was loth to venture my opinion lest her ladyship should think i was angry for i have a good mind to fall upon the widow plea youre a constant man master jolly you have been in that mind this twelvemonths day con you are in the right madam she has it to show under his hand but she will not come in the list with him again she threw him the last year wid come shall we eat oysters whos there call for some wine master jolly you are not warm yet pray be free you are at home jolly your ladyship is merry wid you do not take it ill to have me assure you you are at home here wild such another invitation though in jest will take away master sads stomach oysters not brought in yet sad no faith ned though she should take him it will not take away my stomach my love is so fixed i may wish my wishes but she shall never want them to wait upon hers plea a traitor bind him has pulled down a side profess your love thus public jolly ay by my faith continue master sad to give it out you love and call it a new love a love never seen before well all come to it as your friends sad gentlemen still i love and if she to whom i thus sacrifice will not reward it yet the worst malice can say is i was unfortunate and misfortune not falsehood made me so jolly in what chapter shall we find this written and what verse you should preach with a method master sad wid gentlemen if ever he spoke so much dangerous sense before either of love or reason hang me sad madam my love is no news where you are know your scorn has made it public and though it could gain no return from you yet others have esteemed me for the faith and constancy i have paid here plea did not i foretell you of his love i foresaw this danger shall i never live to see wit and love dwell together capt i am but a poor soldier and yet never reached to the honour of being a lover yet from my own observations master sad take a truth tis a folly to believe any woman loves a man for being constant to another they dissemble their hearts only and hate a man in love worse than a wencher jolly and they have reason for if they have the grace to be kind he that loves the sex may be theirs care when your constant lover if a woman have a mind to him and be blessed with so much grace to discover it he out of the noble mistake of honour hates her for it and tells it perchance and preaches reason to her passion and cries miserable beauty to be so unfortunate as to inhabit in so much frailty capt this counsel makes her hate him more than she loved before these are troubles those that love are subject to while we look on and laugh to see both thus slaved while we are free care my prayers still shall be lord deliver me from love capt tis plague pestilence famine sword and sometimes sudden death sad yet i love i must love i will love and i do love capt in the present tensewid no more of this argument for loves sake capt by any means madam give him leave to love and you are resolved to walk tied up in your own arms with your love as visible in your face as your mistresss colours in your hat that any porter at charing cross may take you like a letter at the carriers and having read the superscription deliver master sad to the fair hands of mistress or my lady suchaone lying at the sign of the hard heart plea and she if she has wit as i believe she hath will scarce pay the post for the packet wid treason how now niece join with the enemy they give the captain wine capt a health ned what shall i call it care to master sad he needs it that avows himself a lover sad gentlemen you have the advantage the time the place the company but we may meet when your wits shall not have such advantage as my love plea no more of love i am so sick ont con by your pardon mistress i must not leave love thus unguarded i vow myself his follower jolly much good may love do him give me a glass of wine here will let them keep company with the blind boy give us his mother and let them preach again hear that will he has good luck persuades me tis an ugly sin to lie with a handsome woman capt a pox upon your nurse she frighted me so when i was young with stories of the devil i was almost fourteen ere i could prevail with reasons to unbind my reason it was so slaved to faith and conscience she made me believe wine was an evil spirit and fornication like the whore of babylon a fine face but a dragon under her petticoats and that made me have a mind to peep under all i met since wid fie fie for shame do not talk so are you not ashamed to glory in sin as if variety of women were none jolly madam we do not glory in fornication and yet i thank god i cannot live without a woman capt why does your ladyship think it a sin to lie with variety of handsome women if it be would i were the wickedst man in the company plea you have been marked for an indifferent sinner that way captain capt who i no faith i was a fool but and i were to begin again i would not do as i have done i kept one but if ever i keep another hang me nor would i advise any friend of mine to do it jolly why i am sure tis a provident and safe way a man may always be provided and sound plea fie upon this discourse capt those considerations betrayed me a pox it is a dull sin to travel like a carriers horse always one road wid fie captain repent for shame and marry capt your ladyship would have said marry and repent no though it be not the greatest pleasure yet it is better than marrying for when i am weary of her my inconstancy is termed virtue and i shall be said to turn to grace beware of women for better for worse for our wicked nature when her sport is lawful cloys straight therefore rather than marry keep a wench jolly faith hes in the right for tis the same thing in number and kind and then the sport is quickened and made poignant with sin capt yet tis a fault faith and ill persuade all my friends from it especially here where any innovation is dangerous twas the newness of the sin that made me suffer in the opinion of my friends and i was condemned by all sorts of people not that i sinned but that i sinned no more care why ay hadst thou been wicked in fashion and privily lain with everybody their guilt would have made themprotect thee so that to be more wicked is to be innocent at least safe a wicked world lord help us capt but being particular to her and not in love nor subject to it taking an antidote every morning before i venture into those infectious places where love and beauty dwell this enraged the maiden beauties of the time who thought it a prejudice to their beauties to see me careless and securely pass by their conquering eyes my name being found amongst none of those that decked their triumphs but from this tis easy to be safe for their pride will not let them love nor my leisure me then the old ladies that pay for their pleasuresthey upon the news beheld me with their natural frowns despairing when their money could not prevail and hated me when they heard that i for my pleasure would pay as large as they jolly gentlemen take warning a fee from every man for by this day theres strange counsel in this confession wild captain you forgot to pledge master careless here will you not drink a cup of wine whos there bring the oysters capt yes madam if you please wild proceed captain plea fie master wild are you not ashamed to encourage him to this filthy discourse capt a glass of wine then and ill drink to all the newmarried wives that grieve to think at what rate their fathers purchase a little husband these when they lie thirsting for the thing they paid so dear for enter a servant with oysters care these methinks should be thy friends and point thee out as a man for them capt yes till the faithful nurse cries alas madam he keeps such a one he has enough at home then she swells with envy and rage against us both calls my mistress ugly common unsafe and me a weak secure fool jolly these are strange truths madam wid ay ay but those oysters are a better jest capt but shes abused that will let such reason tame her desire and a fool in lovesschool else she would not be ignorant that variety is such a friend to love that he which rises a sunk coward from the ladys bed would find new fires at her maids nor ever yet did the man want fire if the woman would bring the fuel plea for gods sake leave this discourse wid the captain has a mind we should eat no oysters wild aunt we came to be merry and we will be merry and you shall stay it out proceed captain wid fie captain i am ashamed to hear you talk thus marry and then youll have a better opinion of women capt marry yes this knowledge will invite me it is a good encouragement is it not think you what is your opinion were not these marriages made in heaven by this good day all the world is mad and makes haste to be fooled but we four and i hope theres none of us believes there has any marriages been made in heaven since adam jolly by my faith tis thought the devil gave the ring there too wid nephew ill swear ill be gone capt hold her ned he points at sad she goes not yet theres a fourth kind of women that concerns her more than all the restecce signum she is one of those who clothed in purple triumph over their dead husbands these will be catched at first sight and at first sight must be caught tis a bird that must be shot flying for they never sit if a man delay they cool and fall into considerations of jointure and friends opinion in which time if she hears thou keepst a wench thou hadst better be a beggar in her opinion for then her pride it may be would betray her to the vanity of setting up a proper man as they call it but for a wencher no argument prevails with your widow for she believes they have spent too much that way to be able to pay her due benevolence wid as i live ill be gone if you speak one word more of this uncivil subject jolly captain let me kiss thy cheek for that widow you understand this widow i say no more here captain heres tothee as it goes down a pox of care wid jesus master jolly have you no observations of the court that are so affected with this of the town con faith they say theres good sport there sometimes plea master jolly is afraid to let us partake of his knowledge jolly no faith madam capt by this drink if he stay till i have eaten a few more ill describe it jolly what should i say tis certain the court is the bravest place in the kingdom for sport if it were well looked to and the game preserved fair but as tis a man may sooner make a set in the strand and it will never be better whilst your divine lovers inhabit there care let the king make me master of the game capt and admit us laitylovers jolly i would he would for as tis theres no hopes amongst the ladies besides tis such an example to see a king and queen good husband and wife that to be kind will grow out of fashion capt nay thats not all for the women grow malicious because they are not courted nay they bred all the last mischiefs and called the kings chastity a neglect of them jolly thou art in the right an edward or a harry with seven queens in buckram that haught among the men and stroked the women are the monarchs they wish to bow to they love no tame princes but lions in the forest capt why and those were properly called the fathers of their people that were indeed akin to their nobility now they wear out their youth and beauty without hope of a monumental ballad or trophy of a libel that shall hereafter point at such a lord and cry that is the royal son of such a one jolly and these were the ways that made them powerful at home for the city is a kind of tame beast you may lead her by the horns any whither if you but tickle them in the ear sometimes queen bess of famous memory had the trick ont and i have heard them say in eightyeight ere i was born as well as i can remember she rode to tilbury on that bonny beast the mayor capt i would i might counsel him id so reform the court care never too soon for now when a stranger comes in and spies a covey of beauties would make a falconer unhood before he can draw his leash he is warned thats a marked partridge and that and every he has by their example a particular she wild by this light the six fair maids stand like the workingdays in the almanac one with a scored upon her breast that is as much as to say i belong to such a lord the next with b for an elder brother c for such a knight d possessed with melancholy and at her breast you may knock an hour ere you get an answer and then shell tell you theres no lodging there she has a constant fellowcourtier that has taken up all her heart to his own use in short all are disposed of but the good mother and she comes in like the sabbath at the weeks end and i warrant her to make any one rest that comes at her care ay marry if she were like the jews sabbath it were somewhat but this looks like a broken commandment that has had more work done upon her than all the week besides capt and what think youis not this finely carried you that are about the king counsel him if he will have his sport fair he must let the game be free as it has been in former ages then a stranger that has wit good means and handsome clothes no sooner enters the privy chamber and beats about with three graceful legs but he springs a mistress that danced as well as he sung better as free as fair those at first sight could speak for wit is always acquainted these fools must be akin ere they can speak and now friends make the bargain and they go to bed ere they know why jolly faith hes in the right you shall have a buzzard now hover and beat after a pretty wench till she is so weary of him shes forced to take her bed for covert and find less danger in being trussed than in flying capt and what becomes of all this pudder after he has made them sport for one night to see him touze the quarryhe carries her into the country and there they two fly at one another till they are weary care and all this mischief comes of love and constancy we shall never see better days till there be an act of parliament against it enjoining husbands not to till their wives but change and lay them fallow jolly a pox the women will never consent to it theyll be tilled to death first wild gentlemen you are very bold with the sex capt faith madam it is our care of them why you see they are married at fourteen yield a crop and a half and then die tis merely their love that destroys em for if they get a good husbandman the poor things yield their very hearts plea and do you blame their loves gentlemen jolly no not their love but their discretion let them love and do a gods name but let them do with discretion wild but how will you amend this jolly instead of two beds and a physician id have the state prescribe two wives and a mistress wild ho it will never be granted the state is made up of old men and they find work enough with one jolly we will petition the lower house there are young men and if it were but to be factious would pass it if they thought the upper house would cross it besides they ought to do it death they provide against cutting down old trees and preserving highways and posthorses and let pretty wenches run to decay care why may it not come within the statute of depopulation as i live the state ought to take care of those pretty creatures be you judge madam ist not a sad sight to see a rich young beauty with all her innocence and blossoms on subject to some rough rude fellow that ploughs her and esteems and uses her as a chattel till she is so lean a man may find as good grass upon the common where it may be shell sit coughing with sunk eyes so weak that a boy with a dog that can but whistle may keep a score of them wid you are strangely charitable to our sex on a sudden capt i know not what they are but for my part ill be a traitor ere ill look on and see beauty go thus to wreck it is enough custom has made us suffer them to be enclosed i am sure they were created common and for the use of man and not intended to be subject to jealousy and choler or to be bought or sold or let for term of lives or years as they are now or else sold at outcries oh yes wholl give most take her wid why do not some of you excellent men marry and mend all these errors by your good example jolly because we want fortunes to buy rich wives or keep poor ones and be loth to get beggars or whores as well as i love em plea why are all their children so that have no fortune think you jolly no not all i have heard of whittington and his cat and others that have made fortunes by strange means but i scarce believe my son would rise from hop a halfpenny and a lambsskin and the wenches commonly having more wit and beauty than money foreseeing small portions grow sad

true lovers of liberty now were the time to bring wenching to that perfection no age could ever have hoped now you may sow such seed of pleasure you may be prayed for hereafter now in this age of zeal and ignorance would i have you four in old clothes and demure looks present a petition to both houses and say you are men touched in conscience for your share in that wickedness which is known to their worships by the pleasure of adultery and desire it may be death and that a law may be passed to that purpose how the women will pray for you and at their own charges rear statues in memory of their benefactors the young and kind would then haunt your chambers pray and present you and court the sanguine youth for the sweet sin secured by such a law none would lose an occasion nor churlishly oppose kind nature nor refuse to listen to her summons when youth and passion calls for those forbidden sweets when such security as your lives are at stake who would fear to trust with this law all oaths and protestations are cancelled letters and bawds would grow useless too by instinct the kind will find the kind and having one nature become of one mind now we lose an age to observe and know a mans humour ere we dare trust him but get this law then tis like and enjoy and whereas now with expense of time and fortune you may glean some one mistress amongst your neighbours wives you shall reap

there not a trick int wid only patience but she has a heavy hand with em they say at first and many of them miscarry she governs them with signs and by the eye as banks breeds his horse there are some too that arrive at writing and those are the right breed for they commonly betake themselves to poetry and if you could light on one of them twere worth your money for tis but using of him ill and

her language an eye like pallas junos wrists a venus for shape and a mind chaste as diana but not so rough never uncivilly cruel nor faulty kind to any no vanity that sees more than lovers pay nor blind to a gallant passion her maxim was he that could love and tell her so handsomely was better company but not a better lover than a silent man thus all passions found her civility and she a value

secret too th allay of waitingwoman makes me hope she may prove metal of the parsons standard find a way to rid me of wanton and ill put in to be chaplain to this merry family if i did not inveigle formal secret you should hang me i know the trick ont tis but praying to and preaching of the waitingwoman then carefully seeing her cushion laid with her book and leaf turned down does it with a few anagrams acrostics and her name in the register of my bible these charm the softsouled sinner then sometimes to read a piece of my sermon and tell her a saturday where my text shall be spells that work more than philtres jolly if you can be serious well think of this at leisure see how they eye wanton care what consulting parson let us be judges betwixt you dye hear jack if he offers ready money i counsel as a friend take it for by this light if you refuse it your wife will not dye see those gay petticoats par yes if you mean my wifes care you know theyre his and she only wears em for his pleasure and tis dangerous to have a wife under another mans petticoats what if you should find his breeches upon her par are not you married too take care that yours does not wear the breeches another kind of danger but as troublesome as that or sore eyes and if she get but a trick of taking as readily as shes persuaded to give you may find a horn at home i have seen a cuckold of your complexion if he had had as much hoof as horn you might have hunted the beast by his slot plea how fine she is and by this light a handsome wench master jolly i am easier persuaded to be reconciled to your fault than any mans i have seen of this kind her eyes have more arguments in em than a thousand of those that seduce the world hang me if those quivers be not full of darts i could kiss that mouth myself is this she my aunt quarrelled with you for jolly the same selfsame and by this hand i was barbarous to her for your aunts sake and had i not scaped that mischief of matrimony by this light i had never seen her again but i was resolved not to quit her till i was sure of a wife for fear of what has followed had i been such an ass to have left her upon the airy hopes of a widows oaths what a case had i been in now you see your aunts provided of a man bless him and send him patience twould have been fine to have seen me walking and sighing upon cold hunting seeking my whore again or forced to make use of some common mercenary thing that sells sin and diseases crimes penance and sad repentance together heres consolation and satisfaction in wanton though a man lose his meal with the widow and faith be freehow do you like my girl rid thee of her what does she want now pray but a jointure to satisfy any honest man speak your conscience ladies dont you think a little repentance hereafter will serve for all the small sins that goodnature can act with such a sinner par pray sir remember shes my wife and be so civil to us both as to forget these things jolly for that jack well understand hereafter tis but a trick of youth man and her jest will make us both merry i warrant thee par pray sir no more of your jests nor your jack remember my coat and calling this familiarity both with my wife and myself is not decent your clergy with christian names are scarce held good christians wid i wonder at nothing so much as master jollys mirth today where lies his part of the jest cosened or refused by all not a fish that stays ins netjolly no whats this jolly hugs wanton show me a fairer in all your streams nor is this my single joy who am pleased to find you may be cosened rejoice to see you may be brought to lie with a man for a jest let me alone to fit you with a trick too care faith it must be some new trick for thou art so beaten at the old one twill neither please thee nor her besides i mean to teach her that myself plea i shall never be perfectly quiet in my mind till i see somebody as angry as myself yet i have some consolation when i think on the wise plot that killed the coachman how the plague red cross and halbert has cut their fingers that designed it their anger will be perfect secret says they are coming and that the lady loveall has given em the alarm enter sad and constant wild and see where the parties comestorms and tempests in their minds their looks are daggers plea servant what youre melancholy and full of wonder i see you have met the news sad yes madam we have heard a report that will concern both your judgment and your honour plea alas sir were innocent tis mere predestination con all weddings master sad you know go by chance like hanging plea and i thank my stars i have scaped hanging to ha been his bride had been both con this is not like the promise you made us yesterday wid why truly servant i scarce know what i do yet the fright of the plague had so possessed my mind with fear that i could think and dream of nothing last night but of a tall black man that came and kissed me in my sleep and slapped his whip in mine ears twas a saucy ghost not unlike my coachman thats dead and accused you of having a hand in his murder and vowed to haunt me till i was married i told my niece the dream plea nay the ghost sighed and accused secret and master sad of making him away confess faith had you a hand in that bloody jest wid fie servant could you be so cruel as to join with my woman against me con tis well ladies why a pox do you look at me this was your subtle plot a pox on your clerks wit you said the jest would beget a comedy when twas known and so i believe twill sad madam i find you have discovered our design whose chief end was to prevent this mischief which i doubt not but youll both live to repent your share of before you have done travelling to the epsoms bourbonne and the spaws to cure those travelled diseases these knightserrant have with curiosity sought out for you tis true they are mischiefs that dwell in pleasant countries yet those roses have their thorns and i doubt not but these gentlemens wit may sting as well as please sometime and you may find it harder to satisfy their travelled experience than to have suffered our homebred ignorance care hark if he be not fallen into a fit of his cousin these names of places he has stolen out of her receiptbook amongst all whose diseases find me any so dangerous troublesome or incurable as a fool a lean pale sighing coughing fool thats rich and poor both being born to an estate without a mind or heart capable to use it of a nature so miserable he grudges himself meat nay they say he eats his meals twice a fellow whose breath smells of yesterdays dinner and stinks as if he had eat all our suppers over again i would advise you master sad to sleep with your mouth open to air it or get the brewer to tun it foh an empty justice that stinks of the lees and casks and belches littleton and plowdens cases dost thou think any woman that has wit or honour would kiss that bunghole by this light his head and belly look as blue and lank as french rabbits or stale poultry alas sir my lady would have a husband to rejoice with no greentailed lecturer to stand sentry at his bedside while his nasty soul scours through him sneaking out at the backdoor these sir are diseases which neither the spaw or bath can cure your garters and willow are a more certain remedy con well sir i find our plots betrayed and we have patience left tis that damned captain has informed sad yet tis one comfort madam that you have missed that man of war that knight of finsbury his dowager with ale and switches would ha bred a ballad plea faith sir you see what a difficulty it is in this age for a woman to live honest though she have a proper man for herhusband therefore it behoves us to consider whom we choose jolly the lady has reason for being allowed but one who would choose such weasels as we see daily married that are all head and tail crooked dirty sordid vermin predestined for cuckolds painted snails with houses on their backs and horns as big as dutch cows would any woman marry such nay can any woman be honest that lets such hodmandods crawl oer her virgin breast and belly or suffer em to leave their slimy paths upon their bodies only for jointures out tis mercenary and base the generous heart has only the laws of nature and kindness in her view and when she will oblige friend is all the ties that nature seeks who can both bear and excuse those kind crimes and i believe one as poor as the despised captain and neglected courtier may make a woman as happy in a friendship as master sad who has as many faults as we have debts one whose father had no more credit with nature than ours had with fortune whose soul wears rags as well as the captains body sad nay then ill laugh for i perceive y are angrier than we alas h has lost both ventureswanton and the widow jolly both and neither so unlucky as to be thy wife thy face is hanged with blacks already we may see the bells toll in thy eyes a bride and a weddingshirt a sexton and a windingsheet a scrivener to draw up jointures a parson to make thy will man by this light hes as chapfallen as if he had lain under the table all night care faith master sad hes parlously in the right neer think of marrying in this dull clime wedlocks a trade youll neer go through with wives draw bills upon sight and twill not be for your credit to protest them rather follow my counsel and marry à la venetiano for a night and away a pistole jointure does it then tis but repenting in the morning and leave your woman and the sin both i th bed but if you play the fool like your friends and marry in serious earnest you may repent it too as they do but wheres the remedy this is spoken a little aside wid what wast you said sir do you repent care by this hand widow i dont know but we have pursued a jest a great way parson are you sure we are married par yes i warrant you for their escaping care their escaping fool thou mistakest me theres no fear of that but i would fain know if there be no way for me to get out of this noose no hole to hide a mans head in from this wedlock par not any but what i presume shell show you anon care hum now do i feel all my fears flowing in upon me wanton and mistress pleasant both grow dangerously handsome a thousand graces in each i never observed before now just now when i must not taste i begin to long for some of their plums wid is this serious sir care yes truly widow sadly serious is there no way to get three or four mouthfuls of kisses from the parsons wife wid this is sad sir upon my weddingday to despise me for such a common thing sad as sad as i could wish this is a jest makes me laughcommon no madam thats too bitter shes forest only where the royal chase is as free as fair wan were not you a widow today sad yes faith girl and as foolish a one as ever coach jumbled out of joint wan stay then till tomorrow and tell me the difference betwixt us sad i hope thoult prove a sheprophet could i live to see thee turn honest wife and she the wanton widow wan i cannot but laugh to see how easy it is to lose or win the opinion of the world a little custom heals all or else whats the difference betwixt a married widow and one of us can any woman be pure or worth the serious sighing of a generous heart that has had above one hand laid upon her is there place to write above one lovers name with honour in her heart tis indeed for one a royal palace but if it admits of more an hospital or an inn at best as well as ours only off from the road and less frequented plea shrewdly urgedwan and though the sins of my family threw me into want and made me subject to the treachery of that broken faith to whose perjury i owe all my crimes yet still i can distinguish betwixt that folly and this honour which must tell you he or she that would be thought twice so was never once a lover con parson thou art fitted a whore and apothegms what sport will she make us under a tree with a salad and sayings in the summer wild come wanton no fury you see my aunts angry wan so am i sir and yet can calmly reason this truth married widows though chaste to the law and custom yet their second hymens make that which was but dyeing in the first husbands bed a stain in the seconds sheets where all their kindness and repeated embraces want their value because theyre sullied and have lost their lustre sad by this light ill go to school to wanton she has opened my eyes and i begin to believe i have scaped miraculously by this hand wench i was within an inch of being married to this danger for what can we call these second submissions but a tolerated lawful mercenariness which though it be a rude and harsh expression yet your carriage deserves it plea fie master sad pray leave being witty i fear tis a mortal sin to begin in the fifth act of your days upon an old subject tooabusing of widows because they despise you wid alas niece let him alone he may come in for his share the parson that has so oft received em will not refuse him tithes there in charity wan that or conveniency interest or importunity may by your example prevail but tis not fair play madam to turn your lover to the common as you call it now hes rid lean in your service take heed master careless and warning master sad you see how fit for the scavengers team your lady leaves her lovers care such a lecture before i had married would ha made me have considered of this matter dost thou hear wanton let us forgive one another being married for that folly has made us guilty alike wan and i would fain know the difference betwixt ours and a wedding crime which is worst to let love youth and goodhumour betray us to a kindness or to be gravely seduced by some aunt or uncle without consideration of the disparity of age birth or persons to lie down before a jointure ladies you may flatter yourselves but the ingenuous part of the world cannot deny but such minds had they been born where our faults are not only tolerated but protected would have listened to the same things interest counsels thereto care parson what boot betwixt our wives either come to a price or draw off your doxy par propose propose here will be mirth anon sad yes yes propose while i break it to your lady madam you see heres a proper man to be had and money to boot what dumb wan no shes only thinking faith madam try em both tonight and choose tomorrow wild come no more of this aunt take my word for your husband that have had more experience of him than all these tis true he will long for these girls as children do for plums and when h has done make a meal upon cheese and you must not wonder nor quarrel at what he says in his humour but judge him by his actions and when he is in his fit and raves most put him into your bed and fold him close in your arms aunt if he does not rise as kind and as good a husband as he that sings psalms best hang me why youre a fool aunt a widow and dislike a longing bridegroom i thought you had known better do you love a spurred horse rather than a ducker that neighs and scrapes i would not say this but that i know him let him not go out of your sight for hes now in seasona ripe mature husband no delays if you let him hang longer upon hope his fruit will fall alone wid you are merry sir but if i had known this humour wild youd ha kissed him first but being ignorant let me make you blush come a kiss and alls friends she kisses careless and he kisses her twice how now sir again again plea aunt look to yourself care um by this light sweetheart and i thank thee nay

in a married life than i upon my weddingday id pass my time in the piazza with the mountebank and let him practise upon my teeth and draw em too ere he persuades the words of matrimony out of my mouth again ay ay master constant you may laugh you ha missed a wife would i were in your case the world should see how cheerfully i should bear such an affliction con jack i ha made my peace at home and by seeing others shipwrecked will avoid the danger and here resolve never to sigh again for any woman theyre weeds grow in every hedge and transplanting of em thus to our beds gives certain trouble seldom pleasure never profit enter captain par see where the enemy comes now if you be wise arm and unite against him as a common foe hes come from his old lady designing a reconciliation the rogues

almanac out of date capt the parsons grown witty and prophesies upon the strength of bridecake if i guess aright thoult be hanged for tis a truth i have been endeavouring to make it appear her fears
