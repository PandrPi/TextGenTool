 chapter one mrs elspeth mcgillicuddy hurried along platform at paddington station after the porter who was carrying her suitcase mrs mcgillicuddy was short and the porter was tall mrs mcgillicuddy was also carrying a lot of packages after a day of christmas shopping so the porter had already turned the corner at the end of the platform while she searched her bag for the ticket at the entrance gate at that moment a voice sounded above her head the train standing at platform is the for brackhampton milchester waverton roxeter and stations to chadmouth passengers for brackhampton and milchester travel at the back of the train mrs mcgillicuddy found her ticket and showed it to the man at the gate who said on the right at the back mrs mcgillicuddy continued up the platform and found her porter waiting outside the door of a thirdclass carriage im travelling firstclass said mrs mcgillicuddy you didnt say so said the porter mrs mcgillicuddy had said so but was too tired to argue the porter carried her suitcase to the next coach where mrs mcgillicuddy sat down alone and opened her magazine five minutes later whistles blew and the train started the magazine slipped from mrs mcgillicuddys hand her head dropped sideways and three minutes later she was asleep she slept for thirtyfive minutes and awoke feeling much better as she sat looking out of the window at the countryside flying past it was almost dark now and the train passed through a station then began to slow down and then it stopped for a short while before it began to move forward again a train passed them going in the opposite direction then another train going in the same direction passed frighteningly close to them for a time the two trains ran parallel and mrs mcgillicuddy looked from her window into the windows of the other carriages most of the blinds were down but occasionally she could see people in the carriages although many of them were empty suddenly when the two trains seemed to have stopped because they were both moving at the same slow speed a blind flew up and mrs mcgillicuddy looked into the lighted firstclass carriage that was only a short distance away then she gasped and stood up standing with his back to the window was a man his hands were round the throat of a woman and he was slowly strangling her her eyes were wide open and her face was purple as mrs mcgillicuddy watched the womans body collapsed at the same time the other train began to go forward faster and a moment later it had passed mrs mcgillicuddys train and disappeared then the door of her carriage opened and a man said ticket please mrs mcgillicuddy turned to him a woman has been strangled in a train that has just passed ours i saw it through there she pointed to the window you must do something at once the ticket collector coughed you dont think that you may have been asleep and er i have been asleep but if you think this was a dream youre wrong i saw it i tell you the ticket collector looked at his watch we shall be in brackhampton in seven minutes i will report what you have told me perhaps you could give me your name and address mrs mcgillicuddy gave him the address where she would be staying for the next few days and her home address in scotland the train was slowing down now and running through the bright lights of a large town as it moved towards a crowded platform the usual voice was saying the train now arriving at platform is the for milchester waverton roxeter and stations to chadmouth her mind went back to the scene on the other train awful really awful and if the blind of the carriage had not by chance flown up then she would not have been a witness to the crime voices shouted whistles blew doors were banged shut the moved slowly out of brackhampton station an hour and five minutes later it stopped at milchester mrs mcgillicuddy collected her packages and her suitcase and got out outside the station a taxi driver came forward are you mrs mcgillicuddy for st mary mead it was a ninemile drive but at last the taxi reached the familiar village street and finally stopped mrs mcgillicuddy got out and walked up the brick path to the door which was opened by a servant while the driver put her bags inside mrs mcgillicuddy walked straight through the hall to where at the open sitting room door stood a fragile old lady elspeth jane they kissed and then without a pause mrs mcgillicuddy cried oh jane ive just seen a murder chapter two miss marple did not look surprised as she said most upsetting for you elspeth i think you should tell me about it at once that was exactly what mrs mcgillicuddy wanted to do so she sat down by the fire and told her story while miss marple listened when she had finished miss marple spoke the best thing i think is for you to go upstairs and have a wash then we will have dinner during which we will not discuss this at all after dinner we can discuss it from every point of view so the two ladies had dinner discussing life in st mary mead and also their gardens then they settled themselves by the fire again and miss marple took out two beautiful old glasses from a corner cupboard and from another cupboard took out a bottle no coffee tonight for you elspeth you are already overexcited and no wonder so i suggest you have a glass of my homemade wine jane said mrs mcgillicuddy as she took an enjoyable sip you dont think do you that i imagined it certainly not said miss marple thank goodness because that ticket collector he thought so very polite but i think elspeth that he behaved quite normally it sounds and indeed is a very strange story but i do not doubt at all that you saw what youve told me you saw the man had his back to you so you didnt see his face no and the woman can you describe her young old between thirty and thirtyfive i think good looking i dont know her face you see was all miss marple said quickly yes yes i understand how was she dressed she had on a palecoloured fur coat no hat her hair was blonde and there was nothing particular that you can remember about the man mrs mcgillicuddy took a little time to think before she replied he was tall and dark i think he had a heavy coat on miss marple paused we shall know more i expect in the morning in the morning well it will be in the morning newspapers after this man had killed her he would be left with a body so he would probably leave the train at the next station can you remember if the carriage had a corridor no it did not then it was a train that was not going far so it would stop at brackhampton he left the train at brackhampton perhaps after arranging the body in a corner seat but of course she will soon be discovered and the news will almost certainly be in the morning papers but it was not in the morning papers miss marple and mrs mcgillicuddy after making sure of this finished their breakfast in silence then mrs mcgillicuddy stood up and turned to her friend well i think said miss marple we should walk down to the police station and talk to sergeant cornish i know him very well so i think hell listen and pass the information on to the right department frank cornish was friendly and respectful he listened to mrs mcgillicuddys story and after she had finished he said that sounds very strange but miss marple believed that her friend was telling the truth and he knew all about miss marple she looked soft and fragile but really she was as sharp and as clever as it was possible to be he said of course you may have made a mistake im not saying you did but a lot of joking goes on it might not have been serious and the woman might not have been dead i know what i saw said mrs mcgillicuddy cornish said you have done everything correctly and you can trust me to start inquiries he turned to miss marple what do you think has happened to the body there seem to be only two possibilities said miss marple the most likely one was that the body was left in the train but that seems unlikely now for it would have been found last night the only other thing the murderer could have done would be to push the body out of the train on to the track so it must be on the track somewhere though that also seems unlikely yes said cornish the body if there is a body ought to have been discovered by now or will be very soon but that day passed and the next day on that evening miss marple received a note from sergeant cornish considering the matter about which you spoke to me full inquiries have been made with no result no womans body has been found i suggest that your friend may have witnessed a scene just as she described but that it was much less serious than she thought chapter three less serious nonsense said mrs mcgillicuddy it was murder she looked at miss marple and miss marple looked back at her go on jane say i imagined the whole thing thats what you think now isnt it anyone can be mistaken miss marple said gently although i think that you were probably not mistaken but i dont think theres anything more you can do thats a relief in a way said mrs mcgillicuddy as im going out to ceylon after christmas to stay with my son roderick and i do not want to put off that visit so if the police choose to be stupid miss marple shook her head oh no the police arent stupid and that makes it interesting doesnt it mrs mcgillicuddy looked surprised one wants to know said miss marple who killed the woman and why and what happened to her body thats for the police to find out exactly and they havent found out which means that the man was very clever i cant imagine how he got rid of it you kill a woman in sudden anger it cant have been planned you would never choose to kill someone just before arriving at a big station so you strangle her and then what can you do miss marple paused mrs mcgillicuddy said well i am going to stop thinking about it and start thinking about the trains to london tomorrow would the afternoon be all right im going to my daughter margarets for tea i wonder elspeth if you would mind taking the we could have an early lunch and i wonder too if margaret would mind if you didnt arrive for tea if you arrived about seven perhaps mrs mcgillicuddy looked at her friend curiously are you planning something jane i suggest elspeth that i could travel up to london with you and that we could then travel back to brackhampton in a train at the same time as you travelled the other day you could then return to london and i would come on here as you did i of course would pay the fares miss marple said firmly what do you expect jane another murder certainly not but i would like to see for myself exactly where the crime was committed and so the next day miss marple and mrs mcgillicuddy sat in two opposite corners of a firstclass carriage speeding out of london on the from paddington but on this occasion no train passed close to them going in the same direction a few trains flashed past them towards london on two occasions trains flashed past them going the other way were due in brackhampton in five minutes said miss marple a ticket collector appeared in the doorway miss marple looked at mrs mcgillicuddy who shook her head it was not the same ticket collector he looked at their tickets and moved on a little unsteadily as the train swung round a long curve and slowed down as it did so there were lights flashing past outside buildings an occasional sight of streets and buses well be there in a minute said mrs mcgillicuddy and i cant really see this journey has been any good at all but this train is a few minutes late was yours on time on friday i think so the train ran slowly into brackhampton station doors opened and shut people got in and out easy thought miss marple for a murderer to leave the station amongst all those people or even to find another carriage and go on in the train to the end of its journey but not so easy to make a body disappear into the air that body must be somewhere mrs mcgillicuddy had got out and spoke now through the open window take care of yourself jane and dont lets worry ourselves any more about all this weve done what we could miss marple nodded goodbye elspeth a happy christmas to you a whistle blew and the train began to move but miss marple did not lean back as it increased speed instead she sat upright mrs mcgillicuddy had said that they had both done all that they could do it was true of mrs mcgillicuddy but about herself miss marple did not feel so sure like a general planning a possible battle miss marple thought through the facts for and against further action for further action were the following my long experience of life and human nature sir henry clithering and his godson now at scotland yard who was so very nice in the little paddocks case my nephew raymonds second boy david who works for british railways griseldas boy leonard who knows so much about maps but i cant go here there and everywhere making inquiries and finding out things im too old for any more adventures she thought watching out of the window the curving line of an embankment a curve very faintly something came into her mind just after the ticket collector had seen their tickets it suggested an idea a completely different idea suddenly miss marple did not feel old at all the next morning miss marple wrote to her greatnephew david west asking for important information fortunately she was invited as usual to the vicarage where griselda and her family lived for christmas dinner and here she was able to ask young leonard about maps leonard loved maps of all kinds and did not wonder why miss marple was interested in a largescale map of a particular area he even found one amongst his collection and lent it to her soon miss marple received a letter from david west it said dear aunt jane ive got the information you wanted there is only one train that it can be the which is a slow train and stops at haling broadway barwell heath brackhampton and then stations to market basing so do i smell some village scandal did you returning from christmas shopping in london by the see the vicars wife being kissed by the tax inspector but why does it matter which train it was yours ever david miss marple smiled it seemed that some more travelling was necessary she went up to london as before on the but this time returned not by the but by the in an empty first class carriage as the train came near to brackhampton running around a curve miss marple pulled down the blind and then stood with her back to the window yes she decided the sudden curving of the line did throw one back against the window and the blind might very easily fly up she looked out of the window it was only just dark but to see things clearly she must make a daylight journey the next day she went up to london by the early morning train then a quarter of an hour before she reached brackhampton miss marple got out the map which leonard had lent her she could see exactly where she was just as the train began to slow down for a curve it was a very big curve and miss marple divided her attention between watching the ground beneath her and looking at the map until the train finally ran into brackhampton that night she wrote a letter to miss florence hill at madison road brackhampton and the next morning she went to the library to read about the local history of the area her idea of what had happened was possible but there was nothing to prove it yet and that would need action the kind of action she was not strong enough to take if her theory were to be definitely proved or disproved she must have help the question was who miss marple thought for a long time then suddenly she smiled and said aloud a name of course lucy eyelesbarrow chapter four lucy eyelesbarrow was thirtytwo she had taken a first in mathematics at oxford and was expected to have a successful academic life but lucy eyelesbarrow as well as being very clever was also very sensible she knew that scholars were not wellpaid and she liked money and to make money she knew that one must do work that is highlyvalued because there are always too few people to do it so to the great surprise of her friends and fellow scholars lucy eyelesbarrow decided to become a highlyskilled professional at housework her success was immediate now after about ten years she was known all over britain it was quite usual for wives to say joyfully to husbands it will be all right i can go with you to america ive got lucy eyelesbarrow because once she came into a house all the worry and hard work went out of it lucy eyelesbarrow did everything she looked after old people and young children got on well with servants and was wonderful with dogs she also cooked perfectly best of all she never minded what she did she washed the kitchen floor dug the garden and carried coal one of her rules was never to accept any job for a long time two weeks or four at the most lucy read the letter from miss marple she had met her two years ago when raymond west the novelist had paid for her to look after his old aunt who had been ill lucy had liked miss marple very much and now the old lady was asking if she could do a certain job for her rather an unusual one perhaps miss eyelesbarrow could meet her so they could discuss it so the next day they met alone in a small dark writing room of lucy eyelesbarrows club in london she said im rather busy at the moment but perhaps you can tell me what it is you want me to do its very simple really said miss marple unusual but simple i want you to find a body what kind of a body asked lucy eyelesbarrow with admirable calm the body of a woman said miss marple who was strangled in a train well thats certainly unusual tell me about it miss marple told her lucy eyelesbarrow listened without interrupting at the end she said well what do you want me to do ive got a theory said miss marple the bodys got to be somewhere if it wasnt found in the train then it must have been pushed out of the train but it hasnt been found anywhere on the line so i travelled down the same way to see if there was a place where the body could have been thrown off the train and yet not on to the line and there was the railway line makes a big curve before getting into brackhampton on the edge of a high embankment if a body was thrown out there when the train was leaning to one side i think it would fall right down the embankment but surely it would still be found even there oh yes it would have to be taken away heres the place on this map lucy studied the place where miss marples finger pointed it is right on the edge of brackhampton now said miss marple but originally it was a country house with large grounds and its still there untouched surrounded by housing estates its called rutherford hall it was built by a man called crackenthorpe a very rich manufacturer in the original crackenthorpes son an elderly man is living there still with i hear a daughter the railway encircles half of the property and you want me to do what i want you to get a job there but it might you know be dangerous i dont know said lucy i dont think danger would worry me i didnt think it would said miss marple what do i look for exactly any signs along the embankment a piece of clothing broken bushes that kind of thing and then lucy asked i shall be staying nearby said miss marple with an old servant of mine florence who lives in brackhampton i think you should mention you have an aunt living in the neighbourhood and that you want a job that is close to her and also that you need some spare time so that you can go and see her i was going on holiday the day after tomorrow lucy said that can wait but i can only stay three weeks after that i have another job if we cant find out anything in three weeks we might as well give up the whole thing said miss marple after miss marple had gone lucy rang up an employment office in brackhampton and explained she needed a job in the neighbourhood to be near her aunt after saying no to several more desirable places rutherford hall was mentioned that sounds exactly what i want said lucy two days later driving her own small car lucy eyelesbarrow passed between two large iron gates a long drive wound between dark bushes up to rutherford hall which was like a small castle but the stone steps in front of the door were broken and the drive was green with weeds she pulled an old bell and an untidy woman opened the door miss eyelesbarrow thats right said lucy the house was very cold inside the woman led her along a dark hall and opened a door to lucys surprise it was a rather pleasant sitting room with books and pretty chairs ill tell miss crackenthorpe youre here said the woman and went away shutting the door after a few minutes the door opened again emma crackenthorpe was a middleaged woman neither good looking nor plain sensibly dressed in warm clothes with dark hair and light brown eyes miss eyelesbarrow she held out her hand then she looked doubtful she had clearly been expecting someone very different from lucy i wonder if this job is really right for you i dont want someone just to organize things i want someone to do the work lucy said you want cooking and washingup and housework thats what i do its a big house you know and we only live in part of it my father and myself i have several brothers but they are not here very often two women come in a mrs kidder in the morning and mrs hart three days a week she paused my father is old and a little difficult sometimes i wouldnt like lucy said quickly im very used to old people and i always manage to get on well with them emma crackenthorpe looked thankful lucy was given a large dark bedroom with a small electric heater and was shown round the house as they passed a door in the hall a voice shouted is that you emma have you got the new girl there bring her in i want to look at her the two women entered the room old mr crackenthorpe was stretched out in a chair he was a big but thin man with thick grey hair a large chin and small lively eyes lets have a look at you young lady lucy advanced confident and smiling theres one thing you must understand straight away just because we live in a big house doesnt mean were rich were not rich we live simply do you hear simply i live here because my father built the house and i like it your home is your castle said lucy youre laughing at me of course not i think its very exciting to have a real country place all surrounded by a town exactly fields with cows in them right in the middle of brackhampton lucy and emma left the room and lucy asked the times of meals and inspected the kitchen then she said cheerfully just leave everything to me lucy got up at six the next morning she cleaned the house prepared vegetables cooked and served breakfast with mrs kidder she made the beds and at eleven oclock they sat down for some tea in the kitchen mrs kidder was a small thin woman miss emma has to put up with a lot from her father she said hes so mean but shes not weak and when the gentlemen come down she makes sure theres something good to eat the gentlemen yes it was a big family the eldest mr edmund he was killed in the war then theres mr cedric he lives abroad somewhere he paints pictures mr harold works in the city in london he married a lords daughter then theres mr alfred he seems very nice but hes been in trouble once or twice and theres miss ediths husband mr bryan ever so nice he is she died some years ago and theres master alexander their little boy hes at school but comes here for the holidays lucy listened carefully to all this information when mrs kidder had gone she cooked lunch and when she had cleared it away and washed up she was ready to start exploring first she walked round the gardens a flower border near the house was the only place that was free of weeds the gardener was a very old man who was only pretending to work in the kitchen garden lucy spoke to him pleasantly he lived in a cottage nearby and behind his cottage was a drive that led through the park and under a railway arch into a rough path every few minutes a train ran over the arch lucy watched the trains as they slowed down to go round the sharp curve surrounding the crackenthorpe property she passed under the railway arch and out into the road on one side was the railway embankment on the other was a high wall and some factory buildings lucy walked along the path until it came out into a street of small houses a woman was walking past and lucy stopped her excuse me can you tell me if there is a public telephone near here theres one at the post office at the corner of the road lucy thanked her and walked along until she came to the post office there was a telephone box at one side she went into it dialled and asked to speak to miss marple a womans voice said shes resting and im not going to wake her who shall i say called miss eyelesbarrow just tell her that ive arrived and that ill let her know when i have any news chapter five the next day in the sitting room after lunch lucy said to emma will it be all right if i just practise a few golf shots in the park oh yes certainly how clever of you to play golf im not much good but its a pleasanter form of exercise than just going for a walk theres nowhere to walk outside this place said mr crackenthorpe nothing but pavements and miserable little box houses theyd like to buy my land and build more of them but they wont until im dead and im not going to die to please anybody i can tell you that i know what theyre waiting for cedric and harold and alfred im surprised he hasnt tried to get rid of me already and perhaps he did at christmastime that was a very strange stomach upset i had dr quimper asked me a lot of questions about it everyone gets stomach upsets sometimes father said emma all right all right say that i ate too much thats what you mean and why did i eat too much because there was too much food on the table and that reminds me you young woman you sent in five potatoes for lunch two potatoes are enough for anybody so dont send in more than four in future the extra one was wasted today it wasnt wasted mr crackenthorpe i am going to use it in a spanish omelette tonight as lucy went out of the room she heard him say shes always got an answer she cooks well though and shes a good looking girl lucy eyelesbarrow took a golf club out of the set she had brought with her and walked out into the park she hit the ball a few times until it landed on the railway embankment then went up and began to look about for it during the afternoon she searched about a third of the embankment nothing then on the next day she did find something a rose bush growing about halfway up the bank had been broken caught on it was a small piece of pale brown fur lucy took some scissors out of her pocket and cut it in half the half she had cut off she put in an envelope as she came down the steep slope she looked carefully at the long grass and at the bottom of the embankment just below the broken rose bush she found a powder compact she put it in her pocket on the following afternoon lucy got into her car and went to see her aunt number madison road was a small grey house in a small grey street but it had a very clean doorstep the door was opened by a tall woman dressed in black who took her to miss marple who was in the sitting room by the fire well lucy said it looks as though you were right she showed miss marple what she had found and told her how she had found them miss marple felt the small piece of fur elspeth said the woman was wearing a lightcoloured fur coat i suppose the compact was in the pocket of the coat and fell out as the body rolled down the slope you didnt take all the fur no i left half of it on the bush very good the police will want to check it you are going to the police with these things well not yet it would be better i think to find the body first but wont that be very difficult i mean the murderer may have taken it anywhere not anywhere said miss marple because then he might much more easily have killed the girl in some remote place and driven the body away from there you havent understood lucy interrupted do you mean that this crime was planned i didnt think so at first said miss marple but isnt it hard to believe that a man suddenly killed a woman then looked out of the window and saw the train going round a curve exactly at a place where he could push the body out and where he could go later and remove it if he had just thrown her out there by chance he wouldnt have done anything else and the body would have been found i think that he must have known all about rutherford hall its geographical position i mean an island surrounded by railway lines it is exactly like that said lucy so if the murderer came to rutherford hall that night before anyone could discover the body the next day how would he come lucy thought theres a rough path beside a factory wall he would probably come that way turn in under the railway arch and along the back drive then he could go to the bottom of the embankment find the body and carry it back to the car and then continued miss marple he took it to some place he had already chosen near rutherford hall the obvious thing i suppose would be to bury it somewhere it wouldnt be easy said lucy he couldnt bury it in the park because someone would notice it then in some farm building that would be simpler there are a lot of old buildings that nobody ever goes near so the next afternoon lucy looked around some of the old farm buildings suddenly she heard someone cough and turned to see the gardener looking at her you should be careful he said that floor is not safe and you were up those steps just now and they arent safe either i was just wondering if this place could be used for growing things lucy said cheerfully everything seems to be in ruins thats because the master wont spend any money but the place could make money if the buildings were mended he doesnt want to make money he knows what will happen after hes dead the young gentlemen will sell the whole place as fast as they can theyre going to get a lot of money when he dies i suppose hes a very rich man said lucy crackenthorpes delights thats what the business was called mr crackenthorpes father started it and made his fortune his two sons were educated to be gentlemen and they werent interested in their fathers business the younger one was killed in a car accident the older one went abroad a lot when he was young and bought a lot of old statues and had them sent home they didnt get on well him and his father but after his father died the older mr crackenthorpe came and lived here him and his family yes in lucy went back to the house and found emma crackenthorpe standing in the hall reading a letter my nephew alexander will be here tomorrow with a school friend alexanders room is the first one at the top of the stairs the one next to it will do for his friend james stoddartwest she said yes miss crackenthorpe ill prepare both rooms theyll arrive before lunch emma paused i expect theyll be hungry roast chicken do you think said lucy and apple tart alexanders very fond of apple tart the two boys arrived the next morning alexander eastley had fair hair and blue eyes stoddartwest was dark and wore glasses during lunch they talked seriously about sport and occasionally about space travel the roast chicken was eaten very quickly and every bit of apple tart disappeared mr crackenthorpe said you two will soon eat all my money alexander looked at him well have bread and cheese if you cant afford meat grandfather of course i can afford it but i dont like waste we havent wasted any sir said stoddartwest looking down at his empty plate after she had washed up lucy went out she could hear the boys calling to each other on the lawn she went down the front drive and began to hunt amongst the bushes with the help of her golf club suddenly the polite voice of alexander eastley made her turn are you looking for something miss eyelesbarrow a golf ball said lucy several golf balls in fact well help you said alexander thats very kind of you i thought you were playing football one cant go on playing football explained stoddartwest one gets too hot do you play a lot of golf i do enjoy it but i dont get much opportunity theres a clock golf set in the house alexander said we could fix it up on the lawn and have a game encouraged by lucy the boys went off to get it later as she returned to the house she found them setting it out on the lawn its a pity the set is so old said stoddartwest you can hardly see the numbers it needs some white paint said lucy you could get some tomorrow good idea alexander said but i think there are some old pots of paint in the long barn shall we go and look whats the long barn asked lucy alexander pointed to a long stone building near the back drive a lot of grandfathers statue collection is in there and it is sometimes used for womens institute events come and see it lucy followed the boys to the barn which had a big wooden door alexander took a key from a nail near the top of the door then he turned it in the lock inside there were three big ugly statues and an even bigger sarcophagus besides these there were two folding tables and some piles of chairs alexander found two pots of paint and some brushes in a corner then the boys went off leaving lucy alone she stood looking at the furniture at the statues at the sarcophagus which had a heavy closefitting lid she looked around and on the floor found a big crowbar it was not easy but she worked with determination and slowly the lid began to rise enough for lucy to see what was inside chapter six a few minutes later she left the barn locked the door put the key back on the nail then drove down to the telephone box i want to speak to miss marple shes resting and im not going to wake her you must wake her its urgent florence did not argue any more soon miss marples voice spoke yes lucy ive found it a womans body yes a woman in a fur coat its in a sarcophagus in a barn near the house i think i ought to inform the police yes you must inform the police but the first thing theyll want to know is why i was lifting up that great heavy lid do you want me to invent a reason no said miss marple you must tell the truth about you about everything lucy suddenly smiled that will be easy for me she said goodbye and rang the police station then she drove back to rutherford hall and went to the library where miss crackenthorpe was reading to her father can i speak to you miss crackenthorpe emma looked up a little nervously well speak up girl speak up said old mr crackenthorpe lucy said to emma id like to speak to you alone please just a moment father emma got up and went out into the hall lucy followed her and shut the door behind them emma said if you think theres too much work with the boys here i can help you and its not that said lucy but i didnt want to speak before your father because it might give him a shock you see ive just discovered the body of a murdered woman in that sarcophagus in the long barn in the sarcophagus a murdered woman its impossible im afraid its true ive told the police they will be here very soon emmas face went a little red you should have told me first before telling the police im sorry said lucy as they heard the sound of a car outside and the doorbell rang through the house im very sorry to have asked you to do this said inspector bacon as he led emma crackenthorpe out of the barn emmas face was pale but she walked steadily i have never seen the woman before thank you miss crackenthorpe thats all i wanted to know i must go to my father i telephoned dr quimper as soon as i heard about this dr quimper came out of the library as they crossed the hall he was a tall friendlylooking man you were right to call me emma he said your fathers all right just go in and see him then get yourself a glass of brandy thats doctors orders emma smiled at him gratefully and went into the library shes one of the best he said looking after her a pity she never married she cares too much for her father i suppose said inspector bacon she doesnt care that much but her father likes being an invalid so she lets him be an invalid shes the same with her brothers cedric thinks hes a good painter harold believes he is good with money and alfred enjoys shocking her with his stories of his clever deals well do you want me to have a look at the body now the police doctor has finished id like you to have a look yes doctor we want to get her identified i suppose its impossible for old mr crackenthorpe it would upset him too much upset him nonsense hed never forgive you if you didnt let him have a look its the most exciting thing thats happened to him for years and it wont cost him anything theres nothing really wrong with him then hes seventytwo thats all thats wrong with him come on lets go and see this body of yours unpleasant i suppose the police doctor says shes been dead for two or three weeks very unpleasant then dr quimper stood by the sarcophagus and looked down at the body ive never seen her before she must have been quite good looking once who found her miss lucy eyelesbarrow they went out again into the fresh air what was she doing looking inside a sarcophagus that said inspector bacon is just what i am going to ask her now about mr crackenthorpe will you disgusting mr crackenthorpe came out of the house i brought back that sarcophagus from rome in or was it calm yourself the doctor said this isnt going to be nice you know i may be ill but ive got to do my duty havent i a very short visit inside the long barn was however long enough mr crackenthorpe came out into the air again with surprising speed ive never seen her before it wasnt rome i remember now it was naples a very fine example and some stupid woman is found dead in it he put a hand on his chest oh my heart doctor doctor quimper took his arm youll be all right after you have had a small brandy they went back together towards the house and now bacon said to himself for miss lucy eyelesbarrow lucy had just finished preparing potatoes for dinner when she was informed that inspector bacon wanted to see her so she followed the policeman to a room where he was waiting now miss eyelesbarrow inspector bacon said you went into the long barn to find some paint is that right and after you found the paint you forced up the lid of this sarcophagus and found the body what were you looking for in the sarcophagus i was looking for a body said lucy you were looking for a body and you found one doesnt that seem to you a very extraordinary story oh yes it is an extraordinary story and lucy told it to him the inspector was shocked are you telling me that you were asked by an old lady to get a job here and to search the house and grounds for a dead body yes who is this old lady miss jane marple she is at the moment living at madison road the inspector wrote it down do you really expect me to believe this lucy said not perhaps until after you have spoken to miss marple i shall speak to her all right she must be mad lucy did not reply to this instead she said what are you going to tell miss crackenthorpe about me why do you ask well ive done what i came here for but im still supposed to be working for miss crackenthorpe and there are two hungry boys in the house and probably some more of the family will arrive after all this upset she needs help but if you tell her that i only took this job in order to hunt for dead bodies shell probably tell me to leave the inspector looked hard at her im not saying anything to anyone at present because i dont yet know whether your statement is true lucy got up thank you then ill go back to the kitchen and get on with things chapter seven so you think we should ask the police in london to help us with this the chief constable looked at inspector bacon you think we should speak to scotland yard the woman wasnt from the local area sir bacon said we believe because of her underwear that she might have been foreign but of course im not saying anything about that until after the inquest tomorrow other members of the crackenthorpe family will be here for it and theres a chance one of them might be able to identify her there is no reason is there to believe the crackenthorpe family are connected with the crime in any way the chief constable asked not apart from the fact that the body was found on their land said inspector bacon what i cant understand is this nonsense about the train ah yes youve been to see this old lady this er miss marple sir yes shes certain about what her friend saw im sure shes just imagining it but she did ask this young woman to look for a body which she did and found one said the chief constable miss jane marple the name seems familiar somehow anyway ill speak to scotland yard i think you are right about it not being a local case the inquest was a formal affair no one came forward to identify the dead woman lucy was asked to give evidence of finding the body and medical evidence was given about the cause of death she had been strangled it was a cold windy day when the crackenthorpe family came out of the hall there were five of them emma cedric harold alfred and bryan eastley the husband of the dead daughter edith there was also mr wimborne the familys london lawyer they all stood for a moment on the pavement a small crowd had gathered there the story of the body in the sarcophagus had been fully reported in both the london and the local press voices were heard saying thats them emma said sharply lets get away she got into the big hired car with lucy mr wimborne cedric and harold followed bryan eastley said ill take alfred in my car the daimler was about to leave when emma cried oh stop there are the boys alexander and james had been left behind at rutherford hall but now they suddenly appeared we came on our bicycles said stoddartwest the policeman was very kind and let us in at the back of the hall but it was rather disappointing said alexander all over so soon we cant stay here talking said harold angrily theres all those men with cameras he gave a sign to the driver who drove away down the road all over so soon said cedric thats what they think the young innocents its just beginning its most unfortunate harold said by the way miss er eyelesbarrow why were you looking in that sarcophagus they all looked at lucy she had wondered when one of the family would ask her this and had already prepared her answer i dont know i did feel that the whole place needed to be cleaned and there was she paused a very unpleasant smell mr wimborne said yes yes of course but this unfortunate young woman was nothing to do with any of us ah but you cant be so sure of that can you said cedric lucy looked at him with interest she had already noticed that the three brothers were very different cedric was a big man with untidy dark hair and a cheerful manner he was still wearing the clothes in which he had arrived from the airport old grey trousers and an old brown jacket he looked bohemian and proud of it his brother harold was the opposite the perfect picture of a city gentleman he was tall with smooth dark hair and was dressed in a suit and a pale grey tie he said really cedric that seems a most unnecessary remark why she was in our barn so what did she come there for mr wimborne coughed possibly some er romantic meeting i have heard that all the locals knew that the key was kept outside on a nail emma said yes it was for the womens institute people mr wimborne coughed again it seems probable that the barn was used in the winter by local lovers there was a disagreement and some young man lost control of himself then he saw the sarcophagus and he realized that it would make an excellent hiding place if i was a girl coming to meet my young man i wouldnt like being taken to a freezing cold barn cedric replied id want a nice warm cinema wouldnt you miss eyelesbarrow do we really need to discuss all this harold said but as he asked the question the car stopped outside the front door of rutherford hall chapter eight as he entered the library mr wimborne looked past inspector bacon whom he had already met to the fairhaired good looking man behind him this is detective inspector craddock of scotland yard inspector bacon said dermot craddock smiled at mr wimborne as you are representing the crackenthorpe family i think that we should give you some confidential information we believe that the dead woman travelled down here from london and that she had recently come from abroad probably from france now i would like to have a quick talk with each member of the family i really cannot see what they can tell me probably nothing i expect i can get most of the information i want from you information about this house and the family and how can that possibly be connected with an unknown woman coming from abroad and being killed here well thats the question said craddock why did she come here had she once had some connection with this house had she been perhaps a servant here or did she come to meet someone else who had lived at rutherford hall can you give me a short history of the family there is very little to tell said wimborne josiah crackenthorpe made sweet and savoury biscuits he became very rich he built this house luther crackenthorpe his eldest son lives here now and the present mr crackenthorpe has never thought of selling the house he is unable to do so said the lawyer because of his fathers will perhaps youll tell me about the will josiah crackenthorpe left his great fortune in trust the income from it to be paid to his son luther for life and after luthers death the capital to be divided equally between luthers children edmund cedric harold alfred emma and edith edmund was killed in the war and edith died four years ago so that on luther crackenthorpes death the money will be divided between cedric harold alfred emma and ediths son alexander eastley and the house that will go to luther crackenthorpes eldest living son or his children was edmund crackenthorpe married no so the property will actually go to the next son cedric said mr wimborne so at present the next generation have no income except what they make or what their father gives them and their father has a large income but no control of the capital exactly mr wimborne stood up i am now going back to london unless there is anything more you wish to know lucy had gone straight to the kitchen when she got back from the inquest and was busy preparing lunch when bryan eastley came in can i help in any way he asked lucy gave him a quick look bryan had arrived alone at the inquest in his small mg sports car and she had not had much time to study him she now saw a friendlylooking man about thirty years old with fair hair and blue eyes the boys arent back yet he said sitting on the end of the kitchen table lucy smiled they were determined not to miss anything do you mind getting off the table mr eastley i want to put this hot dish down there bryan obeyed do you mind me talking to you if you came in to help id rather you helped lucy took another dish from the oven here turn all these potatoes over so that they will get brown on the other side bryan did as he was told then he watched lucy pour the yorkshire pudding mixture into the dish this is fun it reminds me of being in our kitchen at home when i was a boy there was something strangely sad about bryan eastley lucy thought looking closely at him she realized that he must be nearer forty than thirty he reminded her of the many young pilots she had known during the war when she had been only fourteen she had gone on and grown up into a postwar world but she felt that bryan had not gone on but had been left behind she remembered what emma had told her you were a fighter pilot werent you youve got a medal yes and if youve got a medal people try to make things easy for you they give you a job which is very good of them but theyre all office jobs and im just not any good at that sort of thing ive had ideas of my own but if i had a bit of capital he paused at that moment alexander and stoddartwest arrived hello bryan said alexander to his father oh what a good piece of meat is there yorkshire pudding yes there is said lucy shes an excellent cook alexander spoke to bryan like a kindly father to his son can we help you miss eyelesbarrow asked stoddartwest yes you can alexander go and ring the bell james will you carry this dish into the dining room and will you take the meat in mr eastley ill bring the potatoes and the yorkshire pudding when lucy came out into the hall mr wimborne was standing there putting on his coat emma was coming down the stairs and two police officers were coming out of the library mr wimborne took emmas hand in his now this is detective inspector craddock from scotland yard who has come to take charge of the case and he has just told me that this almost certainly was not a local crime they think she came from london and was probably foreign emma crackenthorpe said sharply was she french chapter nine after lunch the police officers asked if they could talk to mr cedric crackenthorpe inspector craddock said i hear you have just come from ibiza you live out there its better than this boring country you get more sunshine than we do i expect said inspector craddock but you came home not very long ago for christmas what made you come back again so soon cedric smiled i got a call from my sister weve never had a murder here before and i didnt want to miss anything also i thought poor emma might need a bit of help managing the old man and the police and everything i see although her two other brothers have also come to be with her but not to cheer her up cedric said harold is very angry about it its not at all suitable for a city man to be mixed up with the murder of a strange female was she a strange female inspector craddock asked i thought perhaps you might be able to guess who she was cedric shook his head i have no idea craddock leaned back in his chair as you heard at the inquest the time of death was between two and four weeks ago which makes it somewhere around christmas when did you arrive in england and when did you leave cedric thought i got here on the saturday before christmas that would be the st you flew straight here yes and got here at midday i flew back on the following friday the th thank you cedric smiled that puts me well within the time of the murder unfortunately but really inspector strangling young women is not my favourite form of christmas fun so what do you think of him craddock asked bacon as cedric shut the door behind him i dont like that type bacon said dirty trousers and did you see his tie it looked as though it was made of coloured string hes just the type who would strangle a woman and think nothing about it well he didnt strangle this one if he didnt leave ibiza until the st and thats a thing we can easily check bacon looked at him i notice that youre not telling them the actual date of the crime no well keep quiet about that for a bit now well see what our correct city gentleman has to say about it all harold crackenthorpe had very little to say about it no he had no idea who the dead woman was yes he had been at rutherford hall for christmas he had been unable to come down until christmas eve but had stayed on over the following weekend inspector craddock then asked to see alfred and when he came into the room craddock felt that he had seen him somewhere before he asked alfred what job he did im in insurance at the moment until recently ive been interested in putting a new type of talking machine on the market i did very well out of that inspector craddock smiled but he was noticing how alfreds suit which had looked smart when he came in was really very cheap cedrics clothes had been dirty but they had been made of excellent material alfreds cheap smartness told its own story craddock began to ask his usual questions and alfred seemed interested its quite an idea that the woman might once have had a job here but as emma didnt recognize her i think thats unlikely and if the woman came from london what made you think she came from london by the way inspector craddock smiled and shook his head not telling eh alfred said did she have a return ticket in her coat pocket is that it inspector craddock thanked alfred and let him go i dont suppose you want to see me said bryan eastley coming into the room i dont really belong to the family you were the husband of miss edith crackenthorpe who died five years ago inspector craddock asked thats right well its very kind of you mr eastley especially if you know something that could help us but i dont i wish i did is it true that she was foreign she may have been french said inspector bacon bryans blue eyes suddenly looked interested really inspector craddock said has anybody in the family got any french connections that you know of bryan shook his head im not being very helpful am i he smiled but alexander and james are out every day hunting for clues theyll probably find something for you inspector craddock said he hoped they would then said he would like to speak to miss emma crackenthorpe inspector craddock looked more carefully at emma crackenthorpe than he had done before he was still wondering about the expression on her face before lunch when wimborne had said the murdered woman was foreign as you have heard we believe the dead woman came from abroad which makes it more difficult for us to identify her but didnt she have anything a handbag papers craddock shook his head you have no idea of her name of where she came from anything at all shes very anxious to know who the woman is craddock thought we know nothing about her he said can you think of anyone she might be i have no idea at all there was a hardness in inspector craddocks voice as he asked when mr wimborne told you that the woman was foreign why did you assume that she was french emma remained calm did i i dont really know why except that most foreigners in this country are french arent they oh i really dont think so miss crackenthorpe people from so many countries come here italians germans belgians craddock looked at inspector bacon who showed her a small powder compact do you recognize this miss crackenthorpe no its not mine youve no idea whose it is no then i dont think we need worry you any more for the present thank you she smiled got up and left the room do you think she knows anything asked bacon inspector craddock said i often think that everyone knows more than they want to tell you but but suddenly the door was thrown open and old mr crackenthorpe came in looking extremely angry so scotland yard comes here and doesnt have the good manners to talk to the head of the family first tell me who is the master of this house you are of course mr crackenthorpe said craddock standing up but we thought that you had already told inspector bacon all you know and as dr quimper said yes yes i am not a strong man but dr quimper is like a silly old woman sometimes and there has been a murder in my own house well in my own barn so what do you want to know whats your theory its a bit early for theories mr crackenthorpe we are still trying to find out who the woman was foreign you say we think so and you think she was involved with one of my sons if so she would be alfreds woman and some violent fellow followed her down here thinking she was coming to meet alfred and killed her hows that but mr alfred crackenthorpe did not recognize her inspector craddock said hes a liar always was and he left the room alfreds woman said bacon i dont think alfred is who were looking for but i did just wonder about that air force fellow bryan eastley yes ive met one or two like him they had danger and death and excitement too early now they find life boring and they dont mind risking things if eastley were mixed up with a woman and wanted to kill her he stopped but if you do kill a woman why put her in your fatherinlaws sarcophagus no none of this family had anything to do with the murder bacon stood up anything more you want to do here craddock said there wasnt so he was going to call on an old friend chapter ten miss marple sitting very straight on florences sofa smiled at inspector dermot craddock im so glad that you have been asked to help with the case i hoped you would be when i got your letter said craddock i took it straight to the ac the assistant commissioner and he had just heard from the brackhampton people asking for our help the ac was very interested in what i had to tell him about you he had heard about you from my godfather dear sir henry said miss marple so he sent me to look into the case and here i am of course this meeting is not an official one im hoping you can put yourself in the murderers place and tell me where he is now miss marple shook her head i wish i could but ive no idea although he must be someone who knows all about rutherford hall i agree but that includes so many people a lot of women have worked there and theres the womens institute and other groups they all know the long barn and where the key was kept also well never begin to solve the crime until we identify the body and that too may be difficult oh well get there in the end were checking up on all disappearances of a woman of that age her fur coat is a cheap one bought in london most of her other clothes were bought in paris the powder compact wasnt any help unfortunately no hundreds of them are sold in paris have you any more ideas for me i was thinking about theatrical companies said miss marple moving from place to place one of those young women would be much less likely to be missed chapter eleven i cant understand you cedric crackenthorpe stepped down from the wall of an old pigsty and looked at lucy eyelesbarrow what cant you understand what youre doing here im doing my job as a servant servant indeed im a professional household help you cant like all the things you have to do lucy laughed not everything perhaps but cooking satisfies my wish to be creative and i really enjoy making things tidy i dont like things to be tidy said cedric yes i can see that some bricks fell out of the pigsty and cedric turned to look inside it dear old madge used to live here she was such a friendly animal and such a good mother we used to come here and scratch her back with a stick she loved it why has this whole place been allowed to get into such a state it cant only be the war youd like to tidy this up too i suppose he paused no its not only the war its my father he refuses to spend any money on the place of course he hates all of us except perhaps emma thats because of my grandfathers will although now hes got nearly as big a fortune as my grandfather left while all of us he stopped as emma came through the door of the kitchen garden hello emma youre looking a bit upset i want to talk to you cedric i must get back to the house said lucy cedrics eyes followed her as she walked away good looking girl who is she really oh shes quite wellknown said emma but forget lucy eyelesbarrow the police think that the dead woman was foreign perhaps french cedric you dont think she could possibly be martinet for a moment or two cedric just looked at her martinet yes she sent that telegram at about the same time do you think she might after all have come down here and nonsense why would martine come down here and go to the long barn you dont think perhaps that i ought to tell inspector bacon or the other one tell him what well about martine about her letter now dont start making things complicated emma i was never sure that letter was from martine anyway i was and i really am worried i dont know what i ought to do nothing said cedric never go halfway to meet trouble thats my advice emma turned and went slowly back to the house as she reached the drive doctor quimper came out and walked towards her well emma murder has given your father a new interest in life i must tell that to my other patients emma smiled but her eyes remained troubled is something wrong dr quimper asked i am worried yes do you want to tell me about it yes because i dont know what to do you remember what i once told you about my brother edmund the one who was killed in the war you mean that he had married or had wanted to marry a french girl yes almost immediately after i got that letter he was killed we never heard anything about the girl all we knew was her first name we thought she would contact us but she didnt we never heard anything until about a month ago just before christmas you got a letter didnt you yes saying she was in england and would like to come and see us it was all arranged and then suddenly she sent a message that she had to return to france well the police think that the murdered woman was french they do do they are you worried that she might be your brothers girl yes i think its unlikely said dr quimper im wondering if i ought to tell the police about it all cedric and the others say its unnecessary what do you think dr quimper was silent for a moment then he said its much simpler if you say nothing i can understand what your brothers feel about it but yes he looked at her and smiled i would just tell them youll keep worrying if you dont i know you emmas face went a little pink im probably being silly you do what you want to do emma and forget the rest of the family i would back your judgment against them any day chapter twelve girl you girl come in here lucy turned her head surprised old mr crackenthorpe was calling to her loudly from a small room he took hold of her arm and pulled her inside i want to show you something lucy looked round her do you want me to clean this room they were in a study but there were piles of dusty papers on the desk and spiders in corners of the ceiling old mr crackenthorpe shook his head no i keep it locked up its my room see these stones theyre very old lucy looked at the piles of stones most interesting youre a clever girl they are interesting ill show you some more things its very kind of you but i really have a lot to do with six people in the house costing me a fortune in food thats all they do when they come down here eat all waiting for me to die emma thinks im an old man you dont think im old do you of course not said lucy sensible girl now im going to show you something he took a key from his pocket and unlocked the door of a dark wooden cupboard from this he took out a surprisingly newlooking money box which he also unlocked do you know what these are my dear he took out some gold coins sovereigns worth a lot more than silly pieces of paper emma doesnt know nobody knows its our secret see girl do you know why im telling you why because theres still lots of life in me and youre a spirited girl so dont throw yourself away on a young man young men are stupid you wait his fingers pressed into lucys arm wait im going to live longer than all of my children and then well see oh yes harolds got no children cedric and alfred arent married emma shell never marry now she rather likes quimper but quimper will never marry emma theres alexander of course yes theres alexander im fond of alexander he paused looking worried well girl what about it miss eyelesbarrow emmas voice came faintly through the closed door lucy said quickly miss crackenthorpes calling me i must go dont forget our secret i wont forget said lucy and hurried out into the hall not sure whether or not mr crackenthorpe had just asked her to marry him dermot craddock sat at his desk at scotland yard talking into the telephone in french it was only an idea you understand yes said the voice from the paris police and already we have two or three possibilities it is a pity that the photograph you sent me is so difficult for anyone to recognize but i will continue to make inquiries as craddock said goodbye a piece of paper was placed on his desk it said miss emma crackenthorpe to see detective inspector craddock as emma came in he offered her a chair miss crackenthorpe you have been worried about something havent you do you perhaps think you know who the dead woman was no no not really that but emma paused you have met three of my brothers i had another brother edmund who was killed in the war just before he was killed he wrote to me from france she opened her handbag took out a letter and read from it i hope this wont be a shock to you emma but im getting married to a french girl i know youll like martine and look after her if anything happens to me please be careful how you tell father hell probably go mad she continued two days after receiving this we had a message saying edmund was missing believed killed later he was definitely reported killed it was just before dunkirk and a time of great confusion there was no army record of his marriage so i was very surprised to receive a letter just about a month ago signed martine crackenthorpe do you have it emma took the letter from her bag and handed it to craddock who read it dear mademoiselle i hope it will not be a shock to you to get this letter i do not even know if your brother edmund told you that we were married he was killed only a few days afterwards after the war ended i decided that i would not contact you i had made a new life for myself but now things have changed it is for my son that i write this letter he is your brothers son you see and i can no longer give him the advantages he ought to have i am coming to england early next week will you tell me if i can come and see you my address for letters is elvers crescent n yours sincerely martine crackenthorpe craddock gave the letter back to emma what did you do when you received this i wrote to the address she gave and invited her to come down to rutherford hall a few days later i received a message from london very sorry had to return to france unexpectedly martine there were no more letters all this happened when just before christmas and you believe that the woman whose body was found in the sarcophagus might be this martine no of course i dont but when you said she was probably foreign well i couldnt help wondering craddock said you were quite right to tell me about this well make some inquiries he paused did you tell your father and your brothers about the letter i had to tell my father of course he got very angry she smiled faintly he was sure it was all made up to get money out of us i also told my brothers harold thought it was made up too and that i should be very careful alfred thought the same but also that it was rather funny cedric just wasnt interested but we all thought that the family should meet martine and that our lawyer mr wimborne should be with us did you try to contact her after you received the message yes i wrote to the address in london with please forward on the envelope but i have had no reply rather a strange business he looked at her sharply what were your feelings about it if this girl really was your brothers widow emmas face softened edmund was my favourite brother so it seemed right for martine to ask his family for help as he had wanted her to do the letter seemed real to me but as harold said if it was written by someone pretending to be martine they must have known her very well for people to believe the letter came from her but still she stopped you wanted it to be true said craddock gently yes i wanted it to be true i would be so happy if edmund had left a son craddock nodded as you say the letter sounds genuine what is surprising is what followed you had replied kindly to her so why even if she had to go back to france did she not write again that is if she really was edmunds widow did perhaps one of your brothers make inquiries that frightened her but of course if edmund crackenthorpe left a son he would be one of the heirs to your grandfathers estate emma nodded well dont worry there is probably no connection at all between the woman who wrote the letter and the woman whose body was found in the sarcophagus emma stood up im so glad i told you when she had gone craddock rang for detective sergeant wetherall bob i want you to go to elvers crescent n take photographs of the dead woman with you ask about a woman calling herself mrs martine crackenthorpe who was either living there or calling for letters there between the th to the end of december right sir craddock was occupied with other matters for the rest of the day but when he returned to his office he found a message from paris on his desk details given by you might fit anna stravinska of ballet maritski suggest you come over dessin craddock smiled at last forget martine crackenthorpe he would go to paris tonight chapter thirteen its so very kind of you to have asked me to tea said miss marple to emma crackenthorpe looking like a picture of a sweet old lady she smiled round her at harold in his dark suit at alfred handing her sandwiches at cedric standing by the fireplace wearing a very old jacket we are pleased that you could come said emma politely this wasnt really true when she had said to her brothers oh i told miss eyelesbarrow that she could bring her aunt to tea today they had not been pleased tell her not to come said harold weve still got a lot to talk about and dont want strangers here let her have tea in the kitchen with the girl said alfred oh let her come said cedric we can ask her about the wonderful lucy im not sure that i trust her shes much too clever shes quite genuine ive made inquiries about her said harold then added emma you must have been mad telling the police that the dead woman might be edmunds french wife it will make them think that one of us killed her i told her not to said cedric then dr quimper encouraged her to tell them and now this old woman is coming to tea just when we want to think said harold but miss marple now sat by the fire smiling up at emma what a beautiful house you have and how delightful to have your brothers with you so often families are separated tell us about lucy as a child miss marple said cedric lucy was always so clever she said yes you were dear particularly at arithmetic why i remember when the butcher overcharged me for a chicken miss marples memories were interrupted by bryan and the boys coming in then tea was brought and with it came dr quimper i hope your fathers not ill emma oh no he was just a little tired this afternoon avoiding visitors i expect said miss marple with a smile dr quimper who was eating coffee cake with great enthusiasm said what a good cook you are emma not mine miss eyelesbarrows you make them just as good said quimper loyally will you come and see father she got up and the doctor followed her miss marple watched them leave the room miss crackenthorpe is a very loving daughter i cant imagine why said cedric father cares about her very much said harold quickly well he knows that emma will always take care of him shell never get married miss marples eyes widened really i think that miss crackenthorpe will probably marry late in life and successfully thats not very likely living here said cedric she never meets anybody she could marry miss marples eyes widened even more there are always vicars and doctors she looked at each of them and it was clear that what she had suggested did not please them she stood up so kind of you to invite me ive been wondering just what your home was like so that i can imagine dear lucy working here lucy took miss marple home on her way back a figure stepped out of the darkness and stood into the light from the car just as she was turning into the back lane he held up his hand and lucy recognized alfred crackenthorpe thats better he said as he got in rutherford hall is so dull i thought id like a nice walk but its cold how do you manage staying here lucy you dont mind if i call you lucy do you not at all i dont find it dull but youre a clever girl too clever to waste yourself cooking and cleaning thank you but i prefer cooking and cleaning to office work but you could do something much more exciting like what well i could use you in my business his hand touched her arm youre a very beautiful girl id like you as a partner thank you lucy drove the car into the yard and stopped you mean no but think about it ill get some money quite soon my father cant live forever what about it lucy what are the terms marriage if you like oh she laughed and opened the car door this is no time for romance theres dinner to think about they entered the house and lucy hurried to the kitchen after dinner she came out into the hall to find harold crackenthorpe waiting for her miss eyelesbarrow can i speak to you about something he opened the door of the sitting room and she followed him in i shall be leaving early in the morning but i want to tell you that i feel that you are too good to be working here do you i dont well he cant ask me to marry him thought lucy hes got a wife already when you have finished here come and see me in london we could use someone of your ability in the company and i can offer you a very good salary lucy said thank you mr crackenthorpe ill think about it dont wait too long or you might miss the opportunity good night miss eyelesbarrow then on her way up to bed lucy met cedric on the stairs lucy theres something i want to say to you do you want me to marry you and come to ibiza and look after you cedric looked very surprised no sorry my mistake i just wanted to know if you have a train timetable in the house is that all theres one on the hall table you know said cedric you shouldnt think everyone wants to marry you youre a good looking girl but not as good looking as all that in fact youre the last girl in the world i would want to marry really said lucy perhaps youd prefer me as a stepmother what cedric looked at her you heard me said lucy and went into her room and shut the door chapter fourteen dermot craddock had arrived at the paris police station armand dessin said i have a picture of the ballet dancers here that is her the fourth from the left do you recognize her a strangled young woman is not easy to recognize it could be her inspector craddock said what do you know about her almost nothing dessin said cheerfully she was not important you see and the ballet maritski it is not important either it has no famous ballerinas but i will take you to see madame joilet who organizes it madame joilet was a businesslike frenchwoman i do not like the police no no madame you must not say that said dessin now about this girl anna stravinska what about her said madame is she russian asked inspector craddock no but they all give themselves russian names she did not dance well she was not good looking was she french perhaps but she told me that she had an english husband was he alive or dead dead or he had left her these girls there is always some trouble with men when did you last see her i took my company to london for six weeks then we came back to france but anna did not come she sent a message that she was going to live with her husbands family i did not think it was true i thought that she had met a man you understand inspector craddock nodded when was this we returned to france the sunday before christmas and anna left two or three days before that madame joilet paused why do you want to find her we think she may have been murdered madame joilet turned away it happens ah well she was a good catholic did you know madame if she had a son if so i know nothing about it madame joilet had nothing more to tell them when they showed her the powder compact she said anna had one like that but so had most of the other girls they then interviewed some of the girls who had worked with anna she liked to pretend things one of them said she told stories about being a film star in hollywood another girl said in london she talked about a very rich man who was going to take her on a holiday around the world because she reminded him of his daughter who had died in a car accident none of this was helpful the only fact they knew was that on th december anna stravinska had decided not to return to france and that on the th december a woman looking a little like her had travelled to brackhampton by the train and had been strangled and if the woman in the sarcophagus was not anna stravinska where was anna now to that madame joilets answer was simple with a man and it was probably correct craddock thought but there was one other possibility that had to be considered because anna had once said that she had an english husband had that husband been edmund crackenthorpe it seemed unlikely considering annas character what was much more probable was that anna had known martine and so it might have been anna who wrote that letter to emma crackenthorpe when craddock got back to the police station sergeant wetherall was waiting with his report elvers crescent is rented to students nobody could recognize the photograph as that of a woman who had called for letters craddock nodded then he rang up the crackenthorpes lawyers and asked for an appointment with mr wimborne the next day he was taken into a room where mr wimborne was sitting behind a large desk what can i do for you inspector this letter craddock pushed martines letter across the table mr wimborne looked at it yes miss emma crackenthorpe informed me about this yesterday morning extraordinary i should have been asked about it when it arrived i had never heard anything about edmund getting married or having a son what would she and the son expect to inherit legally if she could prove her claim craddock asked well if she could prove that the boy was the son of edmund crackenthorpe born after they were married then he would receive his share of josiah crackenthorpes money on the death of luther crackenthorpe more than that he would inherit rutherford hall since hes the son of the eldest son without that proof when luther crackenthorpe dies then cedric gets it yes as the eldest living son but harold and alfred crackenthorpe seem to have been more upset than cedric by this letter is it true that theyre both a bit short of money craddock asked mr wimborne looked at him sharply oh so the police have been making inquiries yes alfred is always short of money and harold is at present in some difficulty but nobodys murdered luther crackenthorpe which is the only murder that would do the family any good so really inspector i dont see where your ideas are leading you the worst of it was inspector craddock thought that he wasnt very sure himself chapter fifteen inspector craddock arranged to see harold crackenthorpe at his office and went there with sergeant wetherall the office was in the city and inside everything looked very expensive and businesslike harold was sitting behind a leathertopped desk in his private room good morning inspector i hope this means that you have some real news for us at last i am afraid not mr crackenthorpe id just like to ask you a few more questions well what is it this time could you tell me exactly what you were doing on the afternoon and evening of th december last say between the hours of pm and midnight crackenthorpes face went an angry red that seems to be a most extraordinary question it is a question for several other people as well as you said craddock well of course i would like to help in any way i can he spoke into one of the telephones on his desk and a neat young woman entered miss ellis the inspector would like to know what i was doing on the afternoon and evening of friday lh december oh yes miss ellis left the room returned with a diary you were in the office on the morning of th december you had a meeting with mr goldie about the cromartie business you lunched with lord forthville ah it was that day yes you returned to the office about three oclock and later you went to sothebys where you were interested in some rare books which were being sold that day you did not return to the office but you were attending the catering club dinner that evening miss ellis left the room yes said harold i went to sothebys but the books i wanted went for too high a price i had tea in a small place in jermyn street russells i think it was called then went home i live at cardigan gardens the catering club dinner was at seven thirty and after it i returned home to bed what time was it when you returned home to dress for the dinner mr crackenthorpe just after six i think and after your dinner it was i think halfpast eleven when i got home did a servant let you in or perhaps lady alice crackenthorpe my wife is in the south of france i let myself in so there is no one who can say that you got home when you say you did harold looked at him coldly i expect the servants heard me come in but really inspector please mr crackenthorpe i know these questions are annoying but i have nearly finished do you own a car yes but i dont use it much except at weekends but you use it when you go down to see your father and sister in brackhampton not unless i am going to stay there for a while if i just go down for one night as for example to the inquest i always go by train where do you keep your car i rent a garage behind cardigan gardens any more questions thats all for now said inspector craddock smiling when they were outside sergeant wetherall said he didnt like those questions at all if you have not committed a murder it naturally annoys you if it seems someone thinks that you have said inspector craddock but what we have to find out is if anyone saw harold crackenthorpe at the rare book sale that afternoon and at the teashop he could easily have travelled by the pushed the woman out of the train and caught a train back to london in time to appear at the dinner he could also have driven his car down that night moved the body to the sarcophagus and driven back again make inquiries in the street where his garage is yes sir do you think thats what he did do how do i know asked craddock hes a tall darkhaired man like the one miss marples friend saw on the train now for brother alfred alfred crackenthorpe had a flat in west hampstead in a big modern building but the flat was small with just a table a single bed and some chairs craddock explained why he had come and asked alfred what he had been doing on the afternoon and evening of th december thats over three weeks ago i never remember times or places except christmas day everyone knows where they were on christmas day and i was with my father at brackhampton and this year your father was ill wasnt he yes caused by eating and drinking more than he was used to but i heard that his doctor was worried ah that stupid quimper its no use listening to him he seemed a rather sensible man to me well hes not so when father felt ill quimper was here all the time asking questions about everything hed eaten and drunk the whole thing was mad craddock didnt say anything so alfred asked angrily why do you want to know where i was on a particular friday three or four weeks ago so you do remember that it was a friday i thought you said it was perhaps i did said inspector craddock anyway friday th is the day i am asking about why have you found out something more about the murdered woman our information is not yet complete alfred gave him a sharp look i hope you dont believe this mad theory of emmas that she might have been edmunds widow thats nonsense emma of course arranged a meeting with the woman very wise said craddock was there a date fixed for this meeting it was to be soon after christmas the weekend of the th he stopped ah said craddock pleasantly so you do remember some dates but you cant tell me what you were doing on friday th december sorry no i probably just wandered around business gets done in bars more than anywhere else i cant tell you what i was doing that day but i can tell you what i wasnt doing i wasnt murdering anyone in the long barn why do you say that mr crackenthorpe come on inspector youre investigating this murder arent you did somebody see the dead woman going into the barn that afternoon she went in and she never came out is that it the sharp black eyes were watching him but inspector craddock said im afraid well have to let you guess about that the police are so secretive not only the police i think mr crackenthorpe you could remember what you were doing on that friday if you tried of course you may have reasons for not wishing to remember the inspecter got up im sorry you couldnt be more helpful mr crackenthorpe im sorry too its all so silly even if the body is the body of edmunds widow why would any of us wish to kill her wed all have enjoyed making father give her money and pay to send her son to a good school sir that chap ive seen him before sergeant wetherall said he was involved with dicky rogers and some of the so ho lot who stole jewellery of course craddock realized why alfreds face had seemed familiar they had all been small crimes and nothing had ever been proved do you think he did it sir i dont know but it explains why he couldnt give himself an alibi so you think hes all right no ones all right just yet said inspector craddock chapter sixteen when craddock got to madison road he found lucy eyelesbarrow with miss marple im not on duty this afternoon miss eyelesbarrow so ive come to see the true expert on murder miss marple looked at him and laughed i told you lucy sir henry clithering his godfather is a very old friend of mine yes and he described her as the best detective in the world not only could she tell you what might have happened and even what actually did happen but also why it happened miss marples face was pink really i just know a little perhaps about human nature living you know in a village do you feel that if you saw the person who had done the murder youd know asked lucy oh i wouldnt say that dear all one can do is to observe people and see of whom they remind you like cedric and the bank manager the bank managers son dear mr eade himself was far more like harold a little too fond of money the sort of man too who would do anything to avoid scandal craddock smiled and who does alfred remind you of mr jenkins at the garage he didnt exactly steal tools but he used to exchange a broken one for a good one and emma continued miss marple she reminds me of geraldine webb always very quiet and bossed around by her elderly mother it was a great surprise when the mother died and geraldine went off on holiday and came back married to a very nice lawyer lucy said what you said about emma marrying seemed to upset the brothers miss marple nodded yes so like men unable to see whats going on in front of them i dont think you noticed either no lucy replied they both seemed to me so old said miss marple but dr quimper isnt much over forty and emma crackenthorpe is under forty the doctors wife died young having a baby so i have heard he must be lonely are we investigating crime or are we arranging a marriage asked lucy miss marple smiled im afraid i am rather romantic and now you have finished what you were doing for me at rutherford hall if you really want a holiday and leave rutherford hall never im the complete detective now almost as bad as alexander and james they spend all their time looking for clues they looked all through the rubbish bins yesterday so if they come to you inspector with a bit of paper with martine if you value your life keep away from the long bam on it youll know that i felt so sorry for them that i hid it in the pigsty inspector craddock looked at her miss eyelesbarrow id like your opinion on something what does the family think about this martine business theyre all furious with emma for going to you about it lucy replied and with dr quimper who encouraged her harold and alfred think the letter wasnt really from martine emma isnt sure cedric agrees with his brothers but he doesnt think its as serious as they do bryan though seems sure that martine wrote the letter why i wonder well bryan just accepts things without question hes rather sweet like a dog that wants to be taken for a walk and do you take him for a walk dear asked miss marple to the pigsties perhaps lucy looked at her sharply youre such a good looking girl i expect all the gentlemen give you a lot of attention gentlemen are all very much alike in some ways even if they are quite old you are extraordinary said lucy how do you know these things but i dont think its my good looks they must think i know something she laughed but inspector craddock did not laugh be careful they might murder you instead of asking you to marry them lucy was suddenly serious i keep forgetting what happened the boys have been having such fun that i began to think of it all as a game but its not a game no said miss marple murder isnt a game she paused will the boys go back to school soon yes next week tomorrow they go to jamess home for the last few days of the holidays im glad of that said miss marple i would not like anything to happen while they are at rutherford hall craddock looked at her thoughtfully you dont believe that an unknown woman was murdered by an unknown man you think that the crime was connected to rutherford hall i think theres a definite connection yes all we know about the murderer is that hes a tall dark man on the day of the inquest when i came out the three brothers were standing waiting for the car i could only see their backs not their faces and it was remarkable how in their heavy overcoats they looked all alike three tall dark men and yet actually theyre all quite different it makes it very difficult i wonder said miss marple whether it might perhaps be all much simpler than we think murders so often are simple with an obvious unpleasant motive if martine exists said craddock there is a motive her reappearance with a son would make the crackenthorpe inheritance smaller theyre all very short of money even harold asked lucy hes been involved in some rather risky deals a large sum of money soon might save him but if so said lucy and stopped i know dear said miss marple its the wrong murder thats what you mean yes martines death wouldnt help harold or any of the others not until not until luther crackenthorpe died exactly and hell go on for years said lucy although he was rather ill at christmastime he said the doctor made a lot of fuss about it anyone would think id been poisoned by the fuss he made thats what he said yes said craddock i want to ask dr quimper about that chapter seventeen the doctor looked very tired that evening as he offered craddock a drink and poured one for himself as well well how can i help you first thank you for advising miss crackenthorpe to come to me with the letter that said it was from her brothers widow oh i didnt exactly advise her to come she wanted to do you think it really was from martine i dont know i never saw it but i think it was probably from someone who knew the facts and was trying to get some money from the family he paused but why ask me ive got nothing to do with it i really came to ask you something else dr quimper looked interested i have heard that at christmas mr crackenthorpe was suddenly rather ill with a stomach upset yes mr crackenthorpe mentioned you im sorry doctor he said you made a silly fuss about it quimper smiled he said you had asked him lots of questions not only about what he had eaten but about who prepared it and served it the doctor was not smiling now go on he said you talked as though you believed someone had poisoned him did you believe that quimper said do you think a doctor can suggest that someone has been poisoned without any proof id just like to know if you suspected he had been poisoned dr quimper said old crackenthorpe usually eats very little when the family comes down emma increases the amount of food result gastroenteritis so you were not at all puzzled all right yes i was puzzled does that please you it interests me said craddock why were you puzzled because there were certain signs that were more like arsenic poisoning than ordinary gastroenteritis although the two things are very much alike and what was the result of your inquiries that what i suspected could not possibly be true mr crackenthorpe told me that he had had similar upsets before i had been his doctor and always when he had eaten too much rich food which was when the house was full with the family or guests yes so i wrote to dr morris he was my older partner who stopped working soon after i joined him i asked about the earlier upsets that mr crackenthorpe had bad and what did he say quimper smiled he told me not to be so silly i wonder crackenthorpe is a healthy old man do you think he might live to be ninety easily and his sons and daughter are all getting older too and they all need money you leave emma out of it shes no poisoner these upsets only happen when the others are there not when she and he are alone very wise of her if she was the poisoner the inspector thought but did not say so he paused but suppose arsenic was put in his food hasnt crackenthorpe been very lucky not to die well yes said the doctor its obviously not a case of small amounts of arsenic given regularly which is the usual method of arsenic poisoning so if these upsets are not from natural causes it looks as though the poisoner is getting it wrong every time why hasnt he increased the amount it doesnt make sense i agree the inspector said it doesnt seem to make sense inspector craddock the excited whisper made him jump craddock had just been going to ring the frontdoor bell when alexander and stoddart west appeared from the shadows weve found a clue alexander said come with us a little unwillingly he followed them round the corner of rutherford hall and into a yard where stoddartwest pushed open a heavy door it really is a clue sir said stoddartwest his eyes shining behind his spectacles we found it this afternoon you see that big rubbish bin said alexander hillman keeps it full of waste paper for when the boiler goes out and he wants to start it again any odd paper thats blowing about he picks it up and puts it in there and thats where we found it found what craddock interrupted the clue show him james stoddartwest took from his pocket an envelope which he handed to the inspector the due had been through the post there was no letter inside it was just a torn envelope addressed to mrs martine crackenthorpe elvers crescent n you see said alexander it shows she was here uncle edmunds french wife stoddartwest interrupted dont you think sir that it must have been her in the sarcophagus youll test it for fingerprints wont you sir of course said craddock good luck for us wasnt it stoddartwest said on our last day too im going to jamess place tomorrow said alexander his parents have got a beautiful house built in the time of queen anne wasnt it william and mary i thought your mother said mums french said stoddartwest she doesnt really know about english houses craddock was examining the envelope how clever of lucy eyelesbarrow to put a post mark on it great fun for the boys come on he said youve been very helpful chapter eighteen the boys led craddock through the back door into the house in the kitchen lucy was rolling out pastry leaning against the wall was bryan eastley hello dad said alexander kindly you out here again i like it out here said bryan have you come to inspect the kitchen inspector not exactly id like to speak to mr cedric crackenthorpe ill go and see if hes in said bryan and left the room is it nearly suppertime asked alexander no said lucy theres some chocolate cake in the food cupboard the boys rushed together out of the door you are very clever said craddock why because of how you did this he showed her the envelope what are you talking about she looked at him craddock suddenly felt a bit faint didnt you put this in the bin for the boys to find what do you mean that craddock put the envelope quickly back in his pocket as bryan returned cedrics in the library cedric seemed delighted to see the inspector so have you found out who the dead woman was we have a good idea but we want to get some statements i would like you to tell me exactly what you were doing on friday th december cedric leaned back well as ive already told you i was in ibiza and one day there is so like another painting in the morning sleep in the afternoon after that some kind of a meal most of the evening in scottys bar with friends will that do id rather have the truth mr crackenthorpe cedric sat up thats a most offensive remark inspector really you told me that you left ibiza on st december and arrived in england that same day yes i did you must think we are very stupid said craddock pleasantly if youll show me your passport i cant find it said cedric i think you could find it but its not really necessary because the records show that you entered this country on the evening of th december perhaps you will now tell me what you did between that time until lunchtime on st december when you arrived here cedric looked very angry you cant do anything you want to anymore somebodys always asking questions and whats special about the th it is the day we believe the murder was committed well yes cedric said i left ibiza on the th there was a very attractive woman on the plane we got to london and stayed at the kingsway palace in case your spies havent found that out yet i called myself john brown and on the th i stayed in bed all morning as id had rather a lot to drink and the afternoon i went into the national gallery then i saw a film then i had a drink or two in the bar and at about ten oclock i went out with the girlfriend to various nightclubs cant remember much more till i woke up the next morning when the girlfriend ran off to catch her plane to america and i poured cold water over my head and then left for this place can any of this be proved mr crackenthorpe say between pm and pm most unlikely said cedric cheerfully the door opened and emma entered the room with a diary in her hand i believe you want to know what everyone was doing on th december inspector craddock er yes miss crackenthorpe well i went into brackhampton for a church meeting that finished about a quarter to one and i lunched with lady adington and miss bartlett at the cadena cafe after lunch i did some christmas shopping i had tea at about a quarter to five in the shamrock tea rooms and then went to the station to meet bryan thank you miss crackenthorpe that is very helpful craddock did not tell her that as she was a woman height five foot seven her movements were not important instead he said your other two brothers came down later alfred came down late on saturday evening he says he tried to phone me that afternoon but i was out harold did not come down until christmas eve craddock took the envelope from his pocket do you recognize this but emma looked at him shocked thats the letter i wrote to martine did she have you found her it is possible that we have found her this empty envelope was found here then it was martine in the sarcophagus it seems very likely said craddock gently it seemed even more likely when he got back to town and found a message from armand dessin one of her friends has had a postcard from anna stravinska the holiday story was true she has reached jamaica and is having a wonderful time craddock crushed the message and threw it into the wastepaper basket chapter ninteen not very helpful said sergeant wetherall craddock was reading through the report on harold crackenthorpes alibi for th december he had been noticed at sothebys at about threethirty but had left soon after that his photograph had not been recognized at russells teashop but his manservant said that he had returned to cardigan gardens to dress for his dinner party at a quarter to seven rather late since the dinner was at seventhirty he did not remember hearing him come in that evening but he often did not hear him the garage where harold kept his car was rented and so no one noticed who came and went there he was at the catering club dinner but left before the end of the speeches said wetherall craddock stretched out his hand for the information on cedric that also was negative though a taxi driver said he might have taken him to paddington station that afternoon dirty trousers and untidy hair he swore a bit because fares had gone up since he was last in england and heres alfred said the sergeant something in his voice made craddock look up wetherall had the pleased look of a man who has kept the best news until the end the check was mainly negative alfred came and went at different times most of his neighbours were out at work all day but towards the end of the report wetheralls large finger pointed to the final words sergeant leakie who had been working on cases of things stolen from lorries had been at a cafe on the waddington brackhampton road watching certain lorry drivers he had noticed at a nearby table chick evans one of the dicky rogers mob with him had been alfred crackenthorpe time pm friday th december alfred crackenthorpe had got on a bus a few minutes later going in the direction of brackhampton william baker ticket collector at brackhampton had checked the ticket of a gentleman whom he recognized as one of miss crackenthorpes brothers just before the train left for paddington he remembered the day because there had been a story of some mad old lady who said she had seen somebody murdered in a train that afternoon it puts him right at the exact place there wetherall said craddock nodded yes alfred could have travelled down by the to brackhampton committing murder on the way then he could have gone out by bus to the cafe he could have left there at ninethirty and would have had plenty of time to go to rutherford hall move the body from the embankment to the sarcophagus and get into brackhampton in time to catch the back to london at rutherford hall there had been a gathering of the crackenthorpe family and very soon voices were raised lucy decided to mix some cocktails in a jug and then took them towards the library the voices sounded clearly in the hall dr quimper came out of the study where he had been with mr crackenthorpe he saw the jug in lucys hand whats this a celebration more like a calming medicine theyre having a big argument in there blaming each other mostly emma are they dr quimper took the jug from lucys hand opened the library door and went in good evening ah dr quimper harold said i would like to know why you involved yourself in a family matter and told my sister to go to scotland yard about it dr quimper said calmly miss crackenthorpe asked my advice i gave it to her you dare to girl mr crackenthorpe looked out of the study door just behind lucy i want curry for dinner tonight you make a very good curry its ages since weve had curry all right mr crackenthorpe lucy went back to the kitchen and began to peel some mushrooms the front door banged and from the window she saw dr quimper walk angrily to his car and drive away it was am when dr quimper drove his car into his garage well mrs josh simpkins now had a healthy baby he went upstairs to his bedroom he was tired very tired he looked with pleasure at his bed then the telephone rang dr quimper yes this is lucy eyelesbarrow from rutherford hall please can you come over everybody here suddenly has an upset stomach ill be over immediately he hurried down to his car again it was three hours later when the doctor and lucy sat down at the kitchen table to drink large cups of black coffee well i think theyll be all right now he said but how did it happen thats what i want to know what did they have for dinner mushroom soup curried chicken and rice fruit jelly all right so most people would say it must have been the mushrooms it wasnt the mushrooms i had some of the soup myself and im all right yes youre all right if you mean no youre a clever girl you would be pretending to be ill too if you had put poison in the food anyway i know all about you i made some inquiries and youre not a girlfriend of either cedric harold or alfred helping them to do unpleasant things do you really think i think quite a lot of things said quimper but i have to be careful what i say now curried chicken did you have some of that no when youve cooked a curry the smell makes you feel youve already eaten it i tasted it of course and i had some jelly how did you serve the jelly in separate glasses and how much of all this has been washed up everything a pity dr quimper said is there any of the food left theres some of the curry and some soup no jelly ill take the curry and the soup he stood up and if you can manage until the morning ill send a nurse here by eight oclock dr quimper put a hand on her shoulder look after two people in particular emma well emma means a lot to me and look after the old man i cant say that hes ever been my favourite patient but he is my patient and im not going to let him be rushed out of the world because one of his unpleasant sons wants his money inspector bacon was looking upset arsenic he said arsenic yes it was in the curry so theres a poisoner at work it seems so said dr quimper and theyve all been ill you say except that miss eyelesbarrow thats a bit strange if miss eyelesbarrow was feeding the family arsenic she would be careful to eat a very small amount of the poisoned curry and then behave as though she was extremely ill and you wouldnt be able to tell that shed had less than the others probably not then there might be one of the family now whos making more fuss than he need yes but i dont think that anyone has had enough arsenic to kill them did the poisoner make a mistake no i think that the idea was to put enough arsenic in the curry to cause signs of food poisoning which everyone would say was because of the mushrooms then one person would probably suddenly get worse and die because he had been given more poison the doctor nodded so perhaps you can go to rutherford hall and tell them all that theyre suffering from arsenic poisoning that will probably stop the poisoner carrying out the rest of his plan the telephone rang on the inspectors desk he picked it up ok yes he said to quimper its your nurse he handed him the receiver quimper speaking i see yes well be with you very soon he put the receiver down and turned to bacon its alfred hes dead chapter twenty alfred craddock said over the phone alfred inspector bacon said you didnt expect that no not at all in fact i thought he was the murderer there was a moments silence then he asked there was a nurse in charge how did she allow it to happen we cant blame her miss eyelesbarrow was very tired and went to bed for a bit the nurse had five patients to look after and old mr crackenthorpe started making a big fuss so she had to go and quieten him down and then took alfred in some tea he drank it and that was the end arsenic again it seems so i wonder said craddock whether alfred was meant to be the victim you mean the tea might have been meant for the old man are they sure that the arsenic was in the tea no the nurse washed the cups and everything but it seems the only likely method so said craddock one of the patients wasnt as ill as the others saw his chance and poisoned the cup well there wont be any more of that said inspector bacon ive got two men there are you coming down as fast as i can lucy eyelesbarrow came across the hall to meet the inspector she looked pale youve been having a bad time said craddock its been like a bad dream about this curry it was the curry yes arsenic was found in it then it must be one of the family who did it there is no other possibility no you see i only started making the curry late after six oclock because mr crackenthorpe specially asked for curry which of them had the chance to do something to the curry while it was cooking lucy thought anyone could have come into the kitchen while i was laying the table in the dining room so who was here in the house mr crackenthorpe emma cedric harold and alfred oh and bryan eastley but he left just before dinner well look after yourself said craddock theres a poisoner in this house remember and one of your patients probably isnt as ill as he pretends to be lucy went upstairs again after craddock had gone and as she passed mr crackenthorpes room she heard him calling girl girl come here lucy entered the room mr crackenthorpe was sitting up in bed looking very cheerful so alfred wont get any of the money theyve all been waiting for me to die alfred in particular now hes dead thats rather a good joke he laughed ill outlive them all chapter twenty one lucy was busy arranging trays to take to the various sick people she picked up the first one and took it upstairs whats this said mr crackenthorpe tea and rice pudding said lucy take it away i told that nurse i wanted meat whats emma doing why doesnt she come and see me shes still in bed mr crackenthorpe women are so weak but youre a good strong girl and ive got a nice store of money and i know who im going to spend it on when the time comes he smiled and tried to hold her hand lucy went rather quickly out of the room the next tray she took in to emma oh thank you lucy but im worried about your aunt she said as lucy put the tray on her knees you havent had any time to go and see her oh dont worry she understands how difficult things have been but as she went down to fetch the next tray lucy decided that she would ring miss marple up as soon as she had taken cedric his meal cedric was sitting up in bed writing hello lucy what awful food have you got for me today i wish you would get rid of that nurse she calls me we for some reason and how are we this morning have we slept well you seem very cheerful said lucy and busy what are you writing plans for what to do with this place when the old man dies if i sell all the land ill have more money than i know what to do with i thought you disliked money of course i dislike money when i havent got any said cedric what a lovely girl you are lucy or do i just think so because i havent seen any good looking women for such a long time i expect thats it said lucy before getting her own lunch she went to the telephone and rang up miss marple im very sorry i havent been able to come over but ive been so busy of course my dear but theres nothing that can be done just now and elspeth mcgillicuddy will be home very soon i wrote to her to come at once you dont think lucy stopped that there will be any more deaths oh i hope not but one never knows does one when someone is really evil i mean lucy rang off and took her tray into the small study she was just finishing her meal when the door opened and bryan eastley came in hello she said this is very unexpected i suppose it is said bryan how is everybody oh much better harolds going back to london tomorrow have you come to stay well id like to if it wont be too much work for you no we can manage said lucy picking up the tray ill do that said bryan taking it from her they went into the kitchen together shall i help you wash up i do like this kitchen in fact i like this whole house he picked up a cloth and began to wipe the spoons and forks it seems a waste it all going to cedric hell just sell it and go abroad again harold wouldnt want this house either and of course its much too big for emma but if it came to alexander he and i would be as happy together here as two children but before alexander could get this place all of them would have to die and thats not likely is it chapter twenty two the next day when lucy heard the doorbell ring she went to answer it expecting to see the doctor but it was not the doctor on the doorstep stood a tall stylish woman in the drive was a rolls royce can i see miss emma crackenthorpe please it was a pleasant voice french perhaps im sorry miss crackenthorpe is ill and cant see anyone i know she has been ill yes but it is very important that i see her you are miss eyelesbarrow i think my son has told me about you i am lady stoddartwest oh i see said lucy lady stoddartwest continued i need to speak to emma because of something that the boys have said to me please will you ask her come in lucy took her visitor into the sitting room then she went upstairs knocked on emmas door lady stoddart west is here she wants to see you about something the boys have told her oh well perhaps i ought to see her lucy led the visitor upstairs opened the bedroom door for her to go in and then shut it lady stoddartwest moved across the room miss crackenthorpe we have met before i think at the sports day at the school yes said emma please sit down lady stoddartwest sat in a chair beside the bed you must think it very strange of me to come like this but the boys have been very excited about the murder that happened here emma said you think we ought to have sent your son home earlier no no that is not what i think oh this is difficult for me but the boys told me that the police think that the murdered woman may be a french girl whom your eldest brother knew during the war is that right it is possible said emma but why do they think that she is martine did she have letters with her no but you see i had a letter from this martine you had a letter from martine yes saying she would like to come and see me i invited her here but got a message saying she was going back to france but then an envelope was found here addressed to her so lady stoddartwest said quickly when i heard this i had to come and tell you something that i never intended to tell you you see i am martine dubois emma stared at her you you are martine but yes i met your brother edmund in the first days of the war he was staying at our house we fell in love we intended to be married and then edmund was killed i will not speak to you of that time but i will say to you that i loved your brother very much then the germans occupied france and i helped englishmen get from france to england that was how i met my present husband he was an air force officer when the war was over i had a new life and did not want to think about the past she paused but it gave me a strange pleasure when i found out that my sons best friend at his school was edmunds nephew i can hardly believe it said emma that you are the martine that dear edmund told me about but was it you then who wrote to me lady stoddartwest shook her head no no of course i did not write to you then emma stopped then there was someone pretending to be martine who wanted perhaps to get money from you but who can it be i have never said anything about it since i came to england emma said we will have to tell inspector craddock she looked with suddenly gentle eyes at her visitor im so glad to know you at last my dear and i you emma leaned back thank goodness i dont know who the poor woman was but if she wasnt martine then she cant be connected to us chapter twenty three the neat secretary brought harold crackenthorpe his usual afternoon cup of tea thanks miss ellis i shall be going home early today i dont really think you should have come in at all mr crackenthorpe you dont look well im all right said harold but he did not feel well he shouldnt really have come into the office but he had wanted to see how the business was going all this he looked round him appeared successful but now it wouldnt be long before his business failed if only his father had died instead of alfred there wouldnt have been anything to worry about but with alfred gone the money from his grandfather would be divided not into five shares but into four looking more cheerful harold got up left the office and drove home darwin his servant opened the door her ladyship has just arrived sir for a moment harold stared at him alice was it really today that alice was coming back from the riviera he had forgotten all about it he had never been in love with her of course but her rich family had been useful though not perhaps as useful as they might have been because he and alice had never had any children he went upstairs into the sitting room my dear how was san raphael alice told him how san raphael was she was a thin woman with sandycoloured hair and pale grey eyes she also asked about her husbands health emmas telegram rather frightened me i read in the paper the other day of forty people in a hotel getting food poisoning all these refrigerators are dangerous people keep things in them too long and forget about them possibly said harold oh and i nearly forgot to tell you theres a parcel for you on the hall table is there i didnt notice it harold went and picked up the parcel which was small and very carefully wrapped he took it back into the sitting room where he opened it inside was a small pill box with two to be taken each night written on it with it was a small piece of paper from the chemists in brackhampton with sent by request of doctor quimper written on it what is it dear said alice you look worried oh its just some pills but im sure the doctor said i need not take any more his wife said calmly he probably said dont forget to take them perhaps he did harold looked across at her and for a moment he wondered exactly what she was thinking that calm expression told him nothing her eyes were like windows in an empty house what did alice feel about him had she ever been in love with him i think i shall go to bed he said its been my first day back in the city yes i think thats a good idea and dont forget to take your pills dear he went upstairs yes it would be wrong to stop taking the pills so soon he took two and swallowed them with a glass of water chapter twenty four nobody could possibly have made more mistakes than i have dermot craddock sat in florences sitting room looking tired and upset ive let a whole family be poisoned alfred crackenthorpes dead and now harolds dead too what going on here poisoned pills said miss marple thoughtfully yes very clever they looked just like the pills that he had been taking but quimper never ordered them and the chemist knew nothing about them either no that box of pills came from rutherford hall do you know it came from rutherford hall yes its the box that held emmas sleeping pills oh i see emmas yes its got her fingerprints on it and the fingerprints of both the nurses and the fingerprints of the chemist nobody elses of course and the sleeping pills were removed and something else put in the box yes what were the pills harold took miss marple asked aconite they are usually kept in a poison bottle i dont know who poisoned harold i dont know who poisoned alfred and now the real martine turns out to be the wife of sir robert stoddartwest so whos the woman in the barn i dont know at first i was sure it was anna stravinska but then shes out of it miss marple gave a small cough but is she well that postcard from jamaica yes said miss marple but anyone can get a postcard sent from almost anywhere dont you think yes said craddock and of course we would have checked that postcard if it hadnt been for the martine business fitting in so well the envelope of the letter emma wrote to her was even found at rutherford hall showing she had actually been there but the murdered woman hadnt been there miss marple said not in the sense you mean she only came to rutherford hall after she was dead oh yes what the envelope really proves is that the murderer was there presumably he took that envelope off her with her other things and then dropped it by mistake or i wonder was it a mistake your men must have searched the place but they didnt find it it only turned up later in the bin you think the boys were meant to find it well it stopped you thinking about anna stravinska any more didnt it but the main fact is that someone was going to pretend to be martine said craddock and then for some reason didnt why thats a very interesting question said miss marple somebody sent a note saying martine was going back to france then arranged to travel down with the girl and kill her on the way you agree not exactly said miss marple i dont think really youre making it simple enough simple so do you or do you not think you know who the murdered woman was its so difficult to explain miss marple said i mean i dont know who she was but im sure who she was if you know what i mean know what you mean craddock shook his head i havent any idea he looked out through the window theres lucy eyelesbarrow coming to see you so ill go my confidence is very low this afternoon and meeting such a clever young woman is too much for me chapter twenty five i suppose it was always sure to cause trouble said lucy walking up and down the room a will leaving money to several people but saying that if when the time came for it to be handed out there was only one person left he would get the lot and yet there was such a lot of money you would think it would be enough the trouble is said miss marple that people always want more money some people they dont start with wanting to commit murder they just start by wanting more than theyre going to have but weve now had three murders and that only leaves two to inherit the money doesnt it you mean cedric and emma said miss marple not emma emma isnt a tall dark man no i mean cedric and bryan eastley i never thought of bryan because hes fair but the other day she paused go on said miss marple it was when lady stoddartwest was leaving she was getting into the car when she suddenly asked who was that tall dark man who was standing on the lawn as i came in i didnt know who she meant at first because cedric was still in bed so i said you dont mean bryan eastley and she said of course squadron leader eastley he was hidden in our house in france once during the war i remembered the way he stood miss marple said nothing and then later i looked at him he was standing with his back to me and i saw that even when a man is fair his hair can look dark if he smooths it down with cream so you see it might have been bryan that your friend saw in the train it might yes said miss marple i had thought of that but the money would go to alexander not to him if anything happened to alexander before he was twenty one then bryan would get the money miss marple said lucy looked shocked he would never do that no father would ever do that miss marple shook her head people do my dear its very sad and very awful but they do she added gently but you mustnt worry elspeth mcgillicuddy will be here very soon now i dont see how that will help no dear perhaps not but i think its important then with a quick look at lucy she said theres something else thats worrying you yes something that i didnt understand until two days ago bryan could in fact have been on that train on the from paddington yes you see emma when talking about her movements on th december said she went to meet bryan at the station the train she met was the from paddington but he could have been on the earlier train and pretended to come on the later one it doesnt really prove anything the awful thing is not knowing what happened and perhaps we never will know of course we will know dear said miss marple the one thing i do know about murderers is that they can never leave things alone particularly after theyve committed a second murder and the great thing is that elspeth mcgillicuddy will be here very soon now chapter twenty six now elspeth you do know what i want you to do yes i know said mrs mcgillicuddy but what i say to you is jane that it seems very strange its not strange at all said miss marple to arrive at the house and to ask almost immediately whether i can er go upstairs its very cold weather if you would just tell me why i must go upstairs jane thats just what i dont want to do said miss marple how annoying you are first you make me come all the way back to england before im sorry about that but someone may soon be killed so you see elspeth it was your duty to come back and thats the taxi now she added as a sound was heard outside the house so mrs mcgillicuddy put on her coat and the two ladies were driven to rutherford hall who can this be emma asked looking out of the window as the taxi moved past it i do believe its lucys old aunt what a bore said cedric tell her youre not at home but at that moment the door was opened by mrs hart who was there that afternoon to clean the silver and miss marple came in with another woman behind her i do hope said miss marple taking emmas hand that this is not inconvenient but im going home the day after tomorrow and so i wanted to say goodbye oh may i introduce my friend mrs mcgillicuddy who is visiting at this moment lucy entered the room aunt jane i had no idea i had to come and thank miss crackenthorpe said miss marple who has been so very very kind to you lucy its lucy whos been very kind to us said emma oh yes said cedric weve certainly made her work for her money looking after us when we were ill running up and down the stairs miss marple interrupted so dangerous isnt it food poisoning mushrooms i heard the cause remains rather mysterious said emma nonsense said cedric arsenic in the curry thats what it was lucys aunt knows all about it im sure well said miss marple i did just hear the door opened and mr crackenthorpe came in wheres tea you girl why havent you brought tea in its just ready mr crackenthorpe lucy went out of the room then reappeared with a tea tray bryan eastley followed her carrying sandwiches and cake whats this whats this mr crackenthorpe asked a decorated cake are we having a party nobody told me about it emmas face went pink dr quimpers coming to tea father its his birthday today and birthday birthdays are only for children i wont let anyone celebrate my birthdays emma what a delightful view you have from this window said miss marple moving across to it just like a picture with the cows there under the trees i cant believe that i am in the middle of a town if the windows were open you would hear far off the noise of the traffic said emma oh of course said miss marple theres noise everywhere isnt there even in st mary mead really the way those jet planes fly over two windows in my little greenhouse were broken the other day i cant understand why its quite simple really said bryan coming to the window miss marple dropped her handbag and bryan politely picked it up at the same moment mrs mcgillicuddy said to emma i wonder could i go upstairs for a moment ill take you said lucy and they left the room together it is very cold outside today said miss marple about planes breaking windows said bryan oh look theres quimper the doctor drove up in his car he came in rubbing his hands its going to snow i think hello emma how are you goodness whats all this you told me today was your birthday said emma so we made you a cake but its years since anyones remembered my birthday he looked almost uncomfortably pleased come on lets have tea said mr crackenthorpe what are we waiting for oh please said miss marple dont wait for my friend she would be most upset if you did they sat down and started tea miss marple reached for a sandwich then paused are they fish said bryan i helped make them mr crackenthorpe laughed poisoned fish thats what they are youve got to be careful what you eat in this house miss marple dont let him stop you said cedric a bit of arsenic is good for the skin they say if you dont have too much eat one yourself boy said mr crackenthorpe all right said cedric he took a sandwich and put it whole into his mouth miss marple also took a sandwich and bit into it i do think its so brave of you all to make these jokes then suddenly she began to choke a fish bone in my throat quimper got up quickly he went across to her moved her backwards towards the window and told her to open her mouth then he looked down into the old ladys throat at that moment the door opened and mrs mcgillicuddy followed by lucy came in mrs mcgillicuddy stopped as she saw the scene in front of her miss marple leaning back and the doctor holding her throat but thats him she cried thats the man in the train with unbelievable speed miss marple escaped from the doctors hands and came towards her friend i thought youd recognize him elspeth no dont say another word she turned to dr quimper you didnt know did you doctor when you strangled that woman in the train that somebody actually saw you do it it was my friend here she was in another train that was running parallel with yours what dr quimper moved quickly towards mrs mcgillicuddy but again with unbelievable speed miss marple was between them yes she saw you and she recognizes you and shell swear to it in court you disgusting old dr quimper stepped towards miss marple but cedric caught him by the shoulder so youre the murderer i never liked you but i never suspected you bryan eastley came quickly to help cedric and at that moment inspector craddock and inspector bacon entered the room dr quimper said bacon i must caution you that you can do what you like with your caution do you really think anyones going to believe what a couple of old women say dr quimper suddenly laughed why should i want to murder a totally strange woman she wasnt a strange woman said inspector craddock she was your wife chapter twenty seven so you see said miss marple it really was very very simple so many men seem to murder their wives mrs mcgillicuddy looked at miss marple and inspector craddock please explain it all to me he saw his chance you see said miss marple of having a rich wife emma crackenthorpe but he couldnt marry her because he had a wife already they had been separated for years but she wouldnt divorce him that fitted very well with what inspector craddock told me of a girl called anna stravinska she had an english husband and she was a catholic so dr quimper decided to kill her the idea of murdering her in the train and later putting her body in the sarcophagus was rather a clever one because it would involve the crackenthorpe family before that he had written a letter to emma which said it was from martine emma had told dr quimper all about her brother you see then he encouraged her to go to the police with her story as he wanted the dead woman to be identified as martine i think he may have heard that inquiries were being made by the paris police about anna stravinska so he arranged to have a postcard come from her from jamaica it was easy for him to meet his wife in london to tell her that he hoped they could be together again and that he would like her to come and meet his family we wont talk about the next part of it which is very unpleasant of course all he wanted was money so perhaps he had already thought about murdering the brothers before he decided to murder his wife anyway he started the idea that someone was trying to poison old mr crackenthorpe to prepare for his other crimes and then he gave arsenic to the whole family not too much of course because he didnt want old mr crackenthorpe to die but i still dont see how he did that said craddock he wasnt in the house when the curry was being prepared oh but there wasnt any arsenic in the curry then said miss marple he added it to the curry afterwards when he took it away to be tested he probably put the arsenic in the cocktail jug earlier then of course it was easy for him as a doctor to poison alfred crackenthorpe and also to send the pills to harold in london everything he did was planned and selfish and cruel i agree said inspector craddock but i thought continued miss marple that if elspeth could see dr quimper in exactly the same position as she had seen him in the train with his back to her bent over a woman he was holding by the throat then she would recognize him that is why i had to prepare my little plan with lucys help i must say said mrs mcgillicuddy it did give me a shock i said thats him before i could stop myself yet i hadnt in fact seen the mans face and i was afraid that you were going to say so elspeth said miss marple and that would have been awful because he thought you really did recognize him i mean he couldnt know that you hadnt seen his face a good thing i said nothing then said mrs mcgillicuddy i wasnt going to let you say another word said miss marple craddock laughed so miss marple what is the happy ending what happens to poor emma crackenthorpe shell soon forget the doctor and perhaps go off on a holiday and meet someone else a nicer man than dr quimper i hope what about lucy eyelesbarrow a wedding there too perhaps said miss marple which of all the men is she going to choose said dermot craddock dont you know said miss marple no i dont said craddock do you oh yes i think so said miss marple and she smiled at him the end
